They have been listed here in brief for reference.\n\n<Mechanic id={375580} name=\"Zephyr Slam\" caption=\"Tank Swap\">\n  \nA tank swap mechanic which deals 240,325 physical damage and knocks the tank back. Subsequent applications apply a stacking 50% vulnerability to the damage and strength of the knockback.\n\nIf Dathea's current target isn't within reach she will cast [Aerial Buffet](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=376851), dealing 96,130 nature damage to her current target. Tanks that can get back to her quickly, or prevent knockbacks, can prevent this damage.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={388302} name=\"Raging Burst\" caption=\"Swirls\">\n  Dathea creates swirls on the ground that inflicts 48,089 damage upon impact. These swirls will\n  spawn a [Raging Tempest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375424) at their location.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={375424} name=\"Raging Tempest\" caption=\"Tornados\">\n\nA tornado moves around the platform dealing 96,130 nature damage and throwing players into\nthe air when hit. They have a couple of effects aside from causing contact dermatitis:\n\n1. They periodically pulse raid damage through [Raging Winds](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=384637).\n2. When Dathea casts [Crosswinds](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=388410) the tornadoes will show an arrow and a swirly indicating a direction and location where they intend to move. Shortly thereafter the tornado rapidly moves to this new location, dealing 72,097 nature damage to any players at the destination and throwing them up in the air.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={391686} name=\"Conductive Mark\" caption=\"Covid Debuff\">\n\nDathea targets a player and applies a DoT that deals 48,082 nature damage instantly and 7,210 nature damage every second for 15 seconds. The debuff also causes the player to take 10% increased nature damage. The debuff is refreshed and duplicated when it comes into contact with another player.\n\nThis is Dathea's mechanic from _The Primal Council_, only without the pillar to clear it. Since this debuff overlaps with nearly every other mechanic it's incredibly dangerous to the player, and the rest of the raid if they spread it to others.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={376943} name=\"Cyclone\" caption=\"Sucky Vortex\">\n\nDathea creates a vortex that pulls players towards her dealing 28,839 nature damage every second for 10 seconds. Players who are pulled into the vortex practice the rapture. This is reasonably countered by raid-movement abilities like [Stampeding Roar](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=77764/stampeding-roar).\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n### Volatile Infuser\n\n<Mechanic id={385812} name=\"Aerial Slash\" caption=\"Tanked Add Ability\">\n\nSlashes their current target with 156,211 nature damage. The add needs to be tanked.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={387627} name=\"Blowback\" caption=\"Large Knockback on Death\">\n\nWhen the Volatile Infuser dies it explodes dealing 60,090 nature damage to all players and doing a considerable knockback. This knockback is used to move across platforms.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={387943} name=\"Diverted Essence\" caption=\"Interruptable Cast\">\n\nThe Infuser gives love to mommy, increasing her damage by 20% for 20 seconds which stacks. The infuser on the main platform will be killed so that [Blowback](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=387627) can take players to the side platform to interrupt the other infuser.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={388562} name=\"Unstable Gusts\" caption=\"Swirls\">\n\nThe Infuser will periodically expel swirls which deal 96,130 nature damage to players caught in the impact.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n### Thunder Caller\n\n<Mechanic id={384273} name=\"Storm Bolt\" caption=\"Persistent Cast\">\n\nThunder Callers are born with an insatiable lust to cast [Storm Bolt](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=384273) which deals 19,226 nature damage. The spell is interruptable and most forms of CC work on the Thunder Callers. They'll be grouped up and killed regardless.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={390449} name=\"Thunderbolt\" caption=\"Platform Vulnerability\">\n\nWhen Thunder Callers spawn they leave a thunderstorm on their respective side platform which makes players take 7,210 nature damage every 2 seconds for 1.5 minutes and increases the damage taken from this ability by 50% per tick.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n## Strategy\n\nThis is a single-phase fight where a portion of the raid needs to split off to deal with adds she spawns on a side platform when she reaches 100 energy. The two large adds cast a boss-empowering ability, whereas the shrimpy ones cast at random players from afar. However, when a player is on a platform they take pulsating damage that applies a `1.5-minute` vulnerability. To counter this the raid will be split into two groups that alternate dealing with the platforming mechanic.\n\nI'll discuss the mechanics players have to deal with on the main platform and then the platform mechanics as a detailed sequence of events.\n\n### Main Platform\n\nThe raid will be decently spread.\n\n- Dodge [Raging Burst](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=388302) swirls and the [Raging Tempest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375424) tornadoes that spawn from them. When Dathea casts [Crosswinds](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=388410) look for nearby tornadoes as they may be aiming through your character even if their impact location is not near you. These tornadoes operate _exactly_ the same way as the King Mechagon fight orbs.\n- Use movement utility to avoid being dragged into [Cyclone](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=376943) and a defensive to dampen the pulsating raid damage it deals.\n- Treat [Conductive Mark](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391686) as if the person has the plague and will kill your whole family if they touch you. The person with the debuff needs to be extremely careful in addition to everyone giving them a wide birth to avoid spreading it. A cascade failure of spreading this mechanic will wipe the raid.\n\n### Platform Sequence\n\n<figure>\n  <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/dathea-rp-1.png\" width=\"1394\" height=\"784\" />\n  <figcaption>\n    There are only two Volatile Infusers, one of which is on the main platform. The second Volatile\n    Infuser and the Thunder Callers are on the activated platform.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nDathea hits 100 energy and this sequence of events will occur:\n\n1. It's announced that `Group 1` should go clear the side platform.\n2. The `Group 1` tank grabs the Volatile Infuser and drags it to the edge of the main platform across from the side platform with the rest of the adds on it. Only one side platform is \"active\" and will have adds on it at a time.\n3. The rest of the players in `Group 1` run to stand between the Volatile Infuser and the edge of the platform, angling themselves so that they are in a direct line from the add to the side platform. Players not going to the side platform should move away to avoid getting knocked off.\n4. Everyone focuses down the Volatile Infuser and interrupts it as it casts. Once it dies it will cast [Blowback](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=387627) which will knock `Group 1` to the side platform.\n5. Focus Thunder Callers while keeping everything interrupted.\n6. `Group 1` repeats standing between the Volatile Infuser and the edge of the platform, killing it, then being knocked back to the main platform.\n\nThe next time Dathea hits 100 energy the same sequence will happen for `Group 2`, then back to `Group 1`, etc.\n\n<Alert type=\"warning\">\n\nThe verbosity and hand-holding of this explanation is intentional. If you aren't in position _before_ killing an Infuser you will likely miss the short [Blowback](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=387627) cast and fail to reach the other platform.\n\nKilling the Thunder Callers must be a priority because if the Volatile Infuser on the side platform dies first everyone will be sent back to the main platform with no way to kill any remaining Thunder Callers.\n\n</Alert>\n\n## Video\n\n<Video src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UP6y-UaT6Q\" />\n",

Doing so inflicts `36,049` damage to the raid and applies [Primal\n  Break](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374864) making the raid 300% more vulnerable to this damage,\n  stacking.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={390548} name=\"Sundering Strike\" caption=\"Tank Swap\">\n  Kurog attacks his current target inflicting `324,438` damage to players in a frontal cone and\n  knocking them back. Players that are hit suffer `28,839` physical damage every second for 35\n  seconds.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={371971} name=\"Elemental Surge\" caption=\"Enrage\">\n  If Kurog is in the middle of the room, aka not in one of the quadrants, he will deal `7,210`\n  elemental damage to the raid every 0.5 seconds, stacking.

This is an enrage mechanic that\n  is hopefully not seen.\n</Mechanic>\n\n### Elemental Altars\n\n<Tabs header>\n  <Tab label=\"Altar of Flame\">\n    \n    ### Altar Mechanics\n\n    <Mechanic id={374881} name=\"Flame Dominance\" caption=\"Altar Raid Damage\">\n      Each altar has a \"dominance\" mechanic causing him to pulse `33,645` damage of the corresponding\n      element type to the raid every 4 seconds.\n\n      Triggering an altar, killing an intermission add associated with an altar, and Kurog casting his ultimate ability at 100 energy each add 10% increased damage to this mechanic.\n    </Mechanic>\n\n    <Mechanic id={382563} name=\"Magma Burst\" caption=\"Debuff Circles\">\n      Kurog hurls magma at several players, dealing `60,081` fire damage to them and causing a large fire circle to spawn under them that deals `108,146` fire damage every second to players within it.\n\n      Players should bait this mechanic away from the raid as the circle lasts a long time.\n    </Mechanic>\n\n    <Mechanic id={373329} name=\"Molten Rupture\" caption=\"Fire Lines\">\n\n      Kurog radiates fire lines dealing `180,243` fire damage to players hit by them.\n\n    </Mechanic>\n\n    <Mechanic id={374022} name=\"Searing Carnage\" caption=\"Trailing Fire Bombs\">\n\n      Several players are infused with fire, causing them to leave a fire swirly in their path every 1 second for 5 seconds. Each swirly explodes after 2 seconds dealing `447,962` fire damage to players hit.\n\n      This is a typical bombardment-style mechanic where the player should keep moving to avoid the swirly and also avoid placing it under other players.\n\n    </Mechanic>\n\n    ### Intermission — Blazing Fiend\n\n    <Mechanic id={375828} name=\"Blistering Presence\" caption=\"Pulsating Damage\">\n      The raid burns for `2,403` fire damage every second while the Blazing Fiend lives, stacking.\n    </Mechanic>\n\n    <Mechanic id={374485} name=\"Magma Flow\" caption=\"Dodge\">\n      Magma pools form at random locations that inflict `108,146` damage when stood in.\n    </Mechanic>\n\n    <Mechanic id={376063} name=\"Smoldering Hellion\" caption=\"Interrupt & Kill\">\n      Adds will spawn from the magma pools, targeting random players with an interruptable cast that deals `76,094` fire damage.\n    </Mechanic>\n\n  </Tab>\n  \n  <Tab label=\"Altar of Frost\">\n\n    ### Altar Mechanics\n\n    <Mechanic id={374916} name=\"Frost Dominance\" caption=\"Altar Raid Damage\">\n      Each altar has a \"dominance\" mechanic causing him to pulse `33,645` damage of the corresponding\n      element type to the raid every 4 seconds.\n\n      Triggering an altar, killing an intermission add associated with an altar, and Kurog casting his ultimate ability at 100 energy each add 10% increased damage to this mechanic.\n    </Mechanic>\n\n    <Mechanic id={373678} name=\"Biting Chill\" caption=\"Rot Damage\">\n      Kurog debuffs all players with [Biting Chill](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373678) causing them to take `12,016` frost damage every second for 10 seconds.\n    </Mechanic>\n\n    <Mechanic id={391019} name=\"Frigid Torrent\" caption=\"Dodge Orbs\">\n      Kurog knocks players in melee back and summons orbs every 2 seconds for 4 seconds that travel in lines away from him. Players hit take `180,243` frost damage and are stunned for 6 seconds, though dispellable.\n    </Mechanic>\n\n    <Mechanic id={372456} name=\"Absolute Zero\" caption=\"Soaking Meteor\">\n      A chunk of ice is hurled at two players, inflicting `740,974` frost damage split evenly among all players in the impact location.\n\n      Getting hit gives a player 1 stack of [Frost Bite](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372514). Reaching 2 stacks causes the player to be [Frozen Solid](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372517), stunning the player and receiving a large DoT for 10 seconds. The vulnerability implies two separate soaking groups.\n    </Mechanic>\n\n    ### Intermission — Frozen Destroyer\n\n    <Mechanic id={375825} name=\"Chilling Presence\" caption=\"Pulsating Damage\">\n      The raid shivers for `2,403` frost damage every second while the Frozen Destroyer lives, stacking.\n    </Mechanic>\n\n    <Mechanic id={374623} name=\"Frozen Binds\" caption=\"Interrupt\">\n      The Frozen Destroyer unleashes a frost nova that inflicts `72,097` frost damage to all players and an additional `16,823` frost damage every 2 seconds for 20 seconds and reducing movement speed by 10%, stacking.\n\n      This is interruptable.\n    </Mechanic>\n\n    <Mechanic id={374624} name=\"Freezing Tempest\" caption=\"Stack in Melee\">\n      Winds form around the Frozen Destroyer dealing `96,129` frost damage every second to players farther than 10 yards away.

If we drag Kurog into a different quadrant he will attune himself to the new altar causing [Primal Shift](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374861) — a burst of raid damage and a 20 second vulnerability to this mechanic. Each Altar is fairly straightforward featuring mostly dodging or spreading mechanics.\n\n- The fire altar has [fire lines](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373329) originating from Kurog, spawns magma under players, and features a [bombardment](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374022) mechanic where debuffed players need to run away to avoid exploding fire swirlies that spawn under their feet.\n- The frost altar double dips on the rot damage by periodically [debuffing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373678) the raid, fires [frozen orbs](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391019) from Kurog that deal large damage, and lobs a [meteor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372456) at two players that need to be soaked by melee and ranges separately.\n- The earth altar summons [concentric rings of earth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=395894) players need to dodge, heal through a large [healing absorb](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391055) on several players, and [spawns adds](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374705) that deal large damage to those in the swirly where they spawn as well as needing to be tanked and focused down.\n- The storm altar forces players to spread to avoid hitting each other with a [large exploding debuff](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=390920), [soaking circles](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374217), and avoiding doubling up a [jumping dot](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373487).\n\n<Alert>\n\nAlthough there are a lot of mechanics, most are self-explanitory and will be understood by watching videos and practicing the fight.\n\n</Alert>\n\n### Intermission Overview\n\nAt 100 energy Kurog travels into the middle of the room and becomes immune. He will summon two elementals corresponding to the last two active altars. These elementals deal increasing damage the longer they are alive. Killing them returns Kurog to the main phase whee Kurog retains increased damage we take from our time on the prior altars.\n\n- The fire elemental spawns [pools of fire](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374485) randomly, with each [summoning smaller adds](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=376063) which need to be interrupted and cleaved down.\n- The frost elemental needs to be [interrupted](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374623) and will force players to stack in melee during [Freezing Tempest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374624).\n- The earth elemental has a [tank swap](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374321) and forces players to spread to with a [debuff](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374427) that has an [aftershock](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374430) component.\n- The storm elemental will randomly [teleport behind a player](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374621) and everyone needs to stay away from them.\n\n## Strategy\n\nKurog's altar and intermission mechanics are taken at face value, but we can choose the order of the altars and how long we remain on them. Since the altars deal increasing damage the longer you're on them the safest option is to be on each altar for an equal amount of time.\n\n1. Kurog gains energy linearly, reaching 100 energy and thus entering the intermission 2 minutes into the fight.\n2. We can stay in the intermission for as long as we can heal through the elementals. Kurog will remain at 0 energy while in the intermission.\n3. It's recommended to start at the fire altar and transitin at 50 energy while rotating clockwise throughout the fight. With 2 upstairs phases each lasting 2 minutes each altar is activated for a minute.\n\n[Here is a log of Liquid killing him with this strategy](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/txhM1NdGPB2XzCbm#fight=28).\n\n## Video\n\n<Video src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuT4XNMnkMQ\" />\n",

There are none of the usual phase-based mechanics you see with other council fights, just a lot of cleave.\n\n## Mechanics\n\nRefer to [Mythic Trap — The Primal Council](https://www.mythictrap.com/en/vault/primalCouncil) for detailed visuals and animations of the mechanics. They have been listed here for reference.\n\n### Kadros Icewrath\n\n<Mechanic id={371836} name=\"Primal Blizzard\" caption=\"Stacking DoT, Cleared by Fire\">\n  Kadros will channel a freezing storm when reaching 100 energy, applying a stacking DoT that deals 4.8k Frost damage every second, increaes Frost damage taken by 10%, and reduces Fire damage by 10%, for 15 seconds.\n\nIf you reach 10 stacks you will be entombed in a [Frost Tomb](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371591?dd=15), dealing damage every second until freed. This debuff can be cleared by dipping into [Scorched Ground](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371514?dd=15).\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={372315} name=\"Frost Spike\" caption=\"Interruptable Frost Spell\">\n  An interruptable spell the boss casts that inflicts 48,065 frost damage.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={386440} name=\"Glacial Convocation\" caption=\"Death Knell Ability\">\n  Upon defeat, Kadros will channel [Glacial Convocation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=386440?dd=15)\n  until the other council members are defeated. This deals 48,065 frost damage to all players every\n  6 seconds, and increases over time.\n</Mechanic>\n\n### Dathea Stormlash\n\n<Mechanic id={371624} name=\"Conductive Mark\" caption=\"Ramping DoT, Rub Pillar to Remove\">\n  Dathea will apply [Conductive Mark](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371624?dd=15) to several players that deals 34,444 nature damage on impact and 15,455 nature damage every 2 seconds for 20 seconds. Each tick of the DoT increases nature damage taken by 8%.\n\nComing within 5 yards of another player will copy the effect onto the player. However, coming within 5 yards of an [Earthen Pillar](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=370991?dd=15) will remove the mark.\n\n  <Alert type=\"warning\">On Mythic, the mark is permanent and must be removed with a pillar.</Alert>\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={372394} name=\"Lightning Bolt\" caption=\"Interruptable Nature Spell\">\n  An interruptable spell the boss casts that inflicts 48,065 nature damage.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={372275} name=\"Chain Lightning\" caption=\"Arcing Random Damage\">\n  Inflicts 24,032 damage to a random player and arcs to other nearby players. Unavoidable healer\n  work.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={386375} name=\"Storming Convocation\" caption=\"Death Knell Ability\">\n  Upon defeat, Dathea will channel [Storming\n  Convocation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=386375?dd=15) until the other council members are\n  defeated. This deals 48,065 nature damage to all players every 6 seconds, and increases over time.\n</Mechanic>\n\n### Opalfang\n\n<Mechanic id={370991} name=\"Earthen Pillar\" caption=\"Pillars\">\n  Opalfang summons pillars under several players, dealing 120,162 nature damage and knocking players back if they are hit. Each pillar emits [Quacking Pulse](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396328?dd=15), dealing 2,403 nature damage every 2 seconds to the entire raid until destroyed with [Meteor Axes](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374038?dd=15).\n\nPlayers with [Conductive Mark](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371624?dd=15) can rub their body on the pillar to remove the debuff.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={372056} name=\"Crush\" caption=\"Tank Swap\">\n  Inflicts 240,325 physical damage to her current target and applies a 100% physical damage\n  vulnerability, stacking. This is a standard alternating tank swap.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={386370} name=\"Quaking Convocation\" caption=\"Death Knell Ability\">\n  Upon defeat, Opalfang will channel [Quaking\n  Convocation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=386370?dd=15) until the other council members are\n  defeated. This deals 48,065 nature damage to all players every 6 seconds, and increases over time.\n</Mechanic>\n\n### Embar Firepath\n\n<Mechanic id={374038} name=\"Meteor Axes\" caption=\"Meteor Soak with Alternating Groups\">\n  Embar targets 2 players and throws axes at them, inflicting 309,101 fire damage split between all targets within 10 yards of the targeted player and increases damage taken from [Meteor Axes](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374038?dd=15) by 300% for 15 seconds.\n\nThe axes are thrown in sequence, meaning both axes cannot be stacked as the second hit will be after the vulnerability is applied, so two separate soak groups are needed (melee, ranged). Each Axe spawns [Scorched Ground](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371514?dd=15) miasma which is used to clear [Primal Blizzard](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371836?dd=15) debuffs.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={372027} name=\"Slashing Blaze\" caption=\"Tank Frontal\">\n  Ember will cast a frontal cleave attack at 100 energy that deals 192,260 fire damage and an additional 48,065 damage every 1.5 seconds for 15 seconds, stacking.\n\n  <Alert type=\"warning\">Don't be in front of the boss or die.</Alert>\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={386289} name=\"Burning Convocation\" caption=\"Death Knell Ability\">\n  Upon defeat, Embar will channel [Burning Convocation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=386289?dd=15)\n  until the other council members are defeated. This deals 48,065 nature damage to all players every\n  6 seconds, and increases over time.\n</Mechanic>\n\n## Strategy\n\nThis council fight doesn't have any phases, just mechanics from one boss being countered by another. Positioning recommendations are unclear as baiting the pillars is wonky.\n\n- The bosses need to be killed evenly. A defeated boss becomes invulnerable and they channel raid damage u\n- There are three important mechanical interactions:\n  - Ranged need to default to staying spread to avoid duplicating [Conductive Mark](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371624?dd=15), and then clear these debuffs by rubbing [Earthen Pillars](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=370991?dd=15).\n  - When Kadros is channeling [Primal Blizzard](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371836?dd=15), dip into the [Scorched Ground](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371514?dd=15) flame patches created by [Meteor Axes](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374038?dd=15) to not end up a popsicle.\n  - The two players who get [Meteor Axes](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374038?dd=15) need to stand ontop of [Earthen Pillars](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=370991?dd=15) to destroy them while 3-4 other players help soak each meteor. The meteors have to be soaked separately due to the vulnerability.\n- Interrupt Kadros' [Frost Spike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372315?dd=15) and Dathea's [Lightning Bolt](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372394) so players don't die to overlapping mechanics and keep these casters in melee for cleave.\n- Avoid Embar's [Slashing Blaze](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372027?dd=15) frontal cleave, and the emergence of [Earthen Pillars](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=370991?dd=15).\n\n## Video\n\n<figure>\n  <Video src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toWSHINDlCc\" />\n  <figcaption>\n    While we normally like Stankie's guides, his video for this boss is a lot of him waxing\n    hypothetical and I do not recommend it.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n",

One thing we ignored in normal is that these debuffs deal falloff damage.\n\n    The raid will be central, ideally within the golden area of the platform. The 3 players with the [Static Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381615) debuffs need to quickly coordinate so 1 of them is placed behind the group (<Marker type=\"star\" />) and the other 2 are spread to the farther reaches of the platform (<Marker type=\"diamond\" />, <Marker type=\"triangle\" />).\n\n    Lastly, the adds spawned from [Volatile Current](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=388643) now need to be interrupted twice.\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab label=\"Intermission 1\">\n    <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/raszageth-rp-2.png\" height=\"784\" width=\"1394\" alt=\"\" />\n\n    The first intermission is not notably different. The ruiner adds will periodically give players a circle they have to run out with, and the acolytes get a large haste buff at low health. Don't ignore acolytes and move on to the next ruiner as it will be much harder to interrupt [Storm Bolt](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=385553) if they have the haste buff.\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab label=\"Phase 2\">\n    <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/raszageth-rp-3.png\" height=\"784\" width=\"1394\" alt=\"\" />\n\n    The \"Thaddius marks\" in this phase are now more like \"Anduin marks\" where players of the wrong charge touching will zap each other in quick succession. The mechanic is simple to execute, but may take some practice:\n\n    1. Shortly before the shield begins everyone will spread around the golden circle of the platform. This doesn't mean vaguely spread in a semicircle I mean truly circumnavigating the platform.\n    2. Players with negative charges will move first, and quickly, to the center of the ring and stack on <Marker type=\"cross\" />.\n    3. The remaining positively charged players will then stack on <Marker type=\"square\" />.\n\n    The other mechanics are seen in the first phase with the exception of the large, jumping debuff circle [Fulimating Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377467), but is not different on Heroic.\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab label=\"Intermission 2\">\n    <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/raszageth-rp-4.png\" height=\"784\" width=\"1394\" alt=\"\" />\n\n    The second intermission has double the fun compared to normal. Two of the Colossal Stormfiends will spawn and they spawn stormlings underneath them that try to reach the opposite Stormfiend.They need to be killed somewhat evenly or the surviving Stormfiend will gain a stacking enrage effect every 2 seconds.\n\n    Don't forget that Raszageth continues to breathe on the platform.\n\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab label=\"Phase 3\">\n    <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/raszageth-rp-5.png\" height=\"784\" width=\"1394\" alt=\"\" />\n\n    The last phase is made interesting by [Magnetic Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=399713). A player is selected that will grip everyone to their location after 8 seconds. This also does falloff damage, so the player should be vaguely at another cardinal direction that the raid isn't at on the central ring of the platform without placing everyone in the encroaching miasma.\n\n    Other mechanics such as the tank's [Thunderous Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=386410) and [Tempest Wing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=385574) may require more consideration. Healers can help with the former with tank cooldowns which in turn reduces raid damage, and players with teleports can teleport to avoid the damage from Tempest Wing.\n\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n## Video\n\n<figure>\n  <Video src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=touOuV-nhY8\" />\n  <figcaption>\n    This tldr video includes the heroic differences and isn't 12 minutes long.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n",

      "raw": "\nSennarth 🕸️ is the first interesting boss in my opinion. Featuring a peculiar corkscrew room, heavy movement mechanics, and lots of little ways choose how to interact with the fight.\n\n## Mechanics\n\nRefer to [MythicTrap — Sennarth](https://www.mythictrap.com/en/vault/sennarth) for detailed visuals and animations of the mechanics. They have been listed here for absolutely no reason, at all.\n\n### Phase 1\n\n<Mechanic id={372765} name=\"Breath of Ice\" caption=\"Ice Patches\">\n  Sennarth spits out a bunch of [Icy Ground](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372765?dd=15) patches\n  that deal 19,273 damage per second to players standing in them and causing them to *slide around*.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={371976} name=\"Chilling Blast\" caption=\"DoT, Spread\">\n  Sennarth debuffs several players, dealing 35,334 damage every second for 5 seconds and causing\n  [Frost Expulsion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371979) upon expiration, dealing 108,103 frost\n  damage to all other players within 4 yards.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={372082} name=\"Enveloping Webs\" caption=\"Miasma-Bombing DoT\">\n  \nSennarth inflicts 19,200 physical damage to several players and causes them to drop [Sticky Webbing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372030) on the ground every second for 6 seconds.\n\nPlayers with this debuff should continue moving to avoid bombarding themselves with [Sticky Webbing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372030) stacks. Gaining 10 stacks of this debuff will entomb the player with [Wrapped in Webs](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372044). However, standing in [Sticky Webbing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372030) will prevent the player from being gripped off the platform by [Gossamer Burst](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373405).\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={373405} name=\"Gossamer Burst\" caption=\"Grip Off Platform\">\n  Sennarth inflicts 156,211 damage to the raid and attaches webs to every player. After a short delay she will rapidly attempt to pull everyone off of the platform to their death.\n\nClasses that have immunities to movement impairing effects, teleports, or high-speed movement can run against the mechanic and use their utility. Everyone else, or players focusing on their damage, can step into [Sticky Webbing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372030) until the effect ends and they will not move at all.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={372736} name=\"Permafrost\" caption=\"Old Platforms Deadly\">\n  The boss deals 6,424 frost damage every second, stacking, to players who remain on platforms she\n  has left. If we leave an entombed player behind they'll die to this before the webbing falls off.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={385083} name=\"Web Blast\" caption=\"Tank Swap\">\n  Standard tank swap ability, recommended to swap at 5-8 stacks.\n</Mechanic>\n\n#### Frostbreath Arachnid\n\nThis is a tanked add which spawns once per platform that should be focused down.\n\n<Mechanic id={374112} name=\"Freezing Breath\" caption=\"Frontal Cone\">\n  This is the same as the boss ability, [Breath of Ice](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372765) only\n  with a frontal component. Tanks just need to keep it facing away from the raid.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={373817} name=\"Chilling Aura\" caption=\"Ramping Raid Damage\">\n  While the Frostbreath Arachnid is alive it will pulse 36,039 frost damage to the raid, and increases the damage done by this ability by 20% every time it deals damage. This damage is not avoidable, so the add should be focused down.\n\nThe spider also physically grows in size, which is horrifying.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n#### Caustic Spiderlings\n\n<Mechanic\n  id={372045}\n  name=\"Caustic Eruption\"\n  caption=\"Removes webbing and frees web-trapped players\"\n>\n  Killing a Caustic Spiderling causes it to pop, dealing 48,065 splash damage to players within 5\n  yards. Notably, this explosion also removes [Sticky Webbing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372030)\n  from the ground *and* player as well as freeing anyone [Wrapped in\n  Webs](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372044).\n\nThey do have an aggro table, but their health is low enough that they are likely to die to random cleave damage. This has the benefit of removing webbing from the platform randomly, but if a player is entombed tanks should be prepared to herd a spider to the player to free them.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n### Phase 2\n\n<Mechanic id={372540} name=\"Apex of Ice\" caption=\"Interrupt\">\n  Phase 2 trigger mechanic that Sennarth starts channeling when she reaches the final platform. This\n  permanently covers the platform in [Ice Patch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372765) and deals\n  increasing raid damage until she is interrupted. This should be interrupted as soon as possible.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={372648} name=\"Pervasive Cold\" caption=\"Soft Enrage Vulnerability\">\n  Players are increasingly vulnerable to frost damage on the final platform. This acts as a soft\n  enrage.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={373559} name=\"Glacial Plume\" caption=\"Landmines\">\n  When the boss casts [Chilling Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371976), the spread mechanic from the first phase, players will now leave a [Glacial Plume](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373559) in their wake. This acts as a landmine that lasts until a player steps on it, dealing 96,130 frost damage and knocking them back.\n\n  <Alert>These can be immunity soaked</Alert>\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={371983} name=\"Repelling Burst\" caption=\"Knockback\">\n\n[Gossamer Burst](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373405) is replaced with [Repelling\nBurst](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371983) which knocks players back instead. It is more\ndangerous now as you will also slide backward because of the ice on the platform, making it easy for\nplayers to be pushed into a [Glacial Plume](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373559) which can easily\nkill them.\n\nThis can still be negated with [Sticky Webbing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372030).\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={373048} name=\"Suffocating Webs\" caption=\"Enveloping Webs v2.0\">\n\nSennarth cheats and casts [Enveloping Webs](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372082) but will only drop [Sticky Webbing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372030) at the end of the debuff as well as knocking back the player and instantly entombing them.\n\nThis will only target the active tank.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n## Heroic Strategy\n\nSennarth has an interesting corkscrew room layout that we ascend throughout the fight. The boss starts hanging from the ceiling off the edge of the platform and will ascend to the next platform on a timer. The fight is the same for the first three platforms and switches to phase 2 on the fourth and final platform.\n\n### Phase 1\n\n<figure>\n  <ProseImage\n    src=\"/images/strategies/vault/sennarth-rp-1.png\"\n    width=\"1394\"\n    height=\"784\"\n    alt=\"Phase 1\"\n  />\n  <figcaption>\n    Notice the ranged player moving between the ranged and melee stacks with the [Enveloping\n    Webs](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372082) debuff so melee can use their webs if needed.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n- Practice Covid 6ft guidelines. Aside from falling off the platform, the most damaging ability is the splash component of [Chilling Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371976). The [Icy Ground](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372765) patches peppered on the platform will force players to position with little consistency anyways.\n- Have a plan for [Gossamer Burst](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373405) at all times. Compared to push or pull mechanics in the past, this mechanic shows a web \"arrow\" on your person for 5 whole seconds to warn you of the impending grip because it is **very fast**. If you are caught unprepared there is no guarantee you have the time to save yourself during the grip.\n\n  1. Using [Sticky Webbing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372030) is the safest option for most classes as it negates the grip and grants the most uptime. While this does apply a stacking movement impairing effect it can be removed by standing in a Spiderling explosion which happens often and does negligible damage. _However_, do not overstay your welcome in the webbing and get yourself entombed.\n  2. If your plan is to use a blink, teleport, or movement nullification ability be sure you are consistent. Trying to big brain some last-second disengage only to fly horizontally into oblivion is only going to just make for a funny `gif` and get you yelled at.\n  3. If your plan is to use a speed-increasing ability it's recommended to be relatively far back in the room. You can also run against the mechanic without a speed increase or webbing by being in the back of the room when the pull happens. I would only recommend this to be done out of necessity and not as someone's usual approach.\n  4. Regardless of approach I heavily recommend finding a WeakAura that counts down when the grip is going to start. This will reduce the cognitive load necessary to deal with the mechanic.\n\n  <Alert type=\"warning\">\n    There is conflicting information on whether or not getting gripped and sliding into webbing is\n    meant to stop or slow you. Some reports claim it slows, or doesn't work at all. It is known that\n    standing in webbing *before* the grip starts will prevent you from moving entirely.\n  </Alert>\n\n- Focus down the Frostbreath Arachnid which spawns shortly after arriving on each new platform.\n- As seen in the RaidPlan figure above, when a player is targeted by [Enveloping Webs](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372082) and is thus being bombarded with [Sticky Webbing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372030) it is recommended to place them between the melee and ranged. As in, melee moves backwards with the debuff, ranged move forward, room permitting. Placing webs in the far back of the room takes longer and makes the grip more dangerous.\n\n### Phase 1 \"Intermission\"\n\n<figure>\n  <ProseImage\n    src=\"/images/strategies/vault/sennarth-rp-2.png\"\n    width=\"1394\"\n    height=\"784\"\n    alt=\"Phase 1\"\n  />\n  <figcaption>\n    Each circle is a pillar that can be used to block yourself from falling off the platform during\n    [Gossamer Burst](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373405), but the red ones in the middle are a\n    little riskier.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAfter a while, the boss will slowly and ominously ascend a ramp to the next stretch of the platform. This is still part of phase 1 and she will cast all of the same mechanics during her escalator ride.\n\n[Gossamer Burst](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373405) is more deadly during this intermission as the [Sticky Webbing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372030) is much more scarce. Gold-star players which get [Enveloping Webs](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372082) can place [Sticky Webbing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372030) on the ramp shortly before she starts to ascend.\n\n### Phase 2\n\nThe second phase begins on the fourth and final platform.\n\n<figure>\n  <ProseImage\n    src=\"/images/strategies/vault/sennarth-rp-3.png\"\n    width=\"1394\"\n    height=\"784\"\n    alt=\"Phase 1\"\n  />\n  <figcaption>\n    The <Marker type=\"skull\" /> is where players with [Suffocating\n    Webs](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373048) should huddle together so they aren't knocked too\n    far back, and are centrally grouped to be cleared by Spiderlings.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n- Sennarth descends to the fourth platform and then starts channeling [Apex of Ice](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372540) — permanently covering the entire platform in the slippery [Icy Ground](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372765) as well as taking 99% reduced damage and pulsing increasing raid damage until this cast is interrupted.\n- Everyone becomes progressively more vulnerable to frost damage through [Pervasive Cold](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372648), acting as her soft-enrage.\n- Players should remain spread out to avoid cleaving each other with [Chilling Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371976) as well as avoiding the [Glacial Plume](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373559) landmines these debuffs now leave in their wake.\n- Instead of gripping, the boss now does a knockback called [Repelling Burst](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371983). Players should avoid getting knocked off the platform or into [Glacial Plume](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373559) by using [Sticky Webbing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372030), utility, or proper aiming.\n- [Suffocating Webs](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373048) will entomb those affected, knocking them back, and will only drop a single [Sticky Webbing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372030). This will also be cast on the active tank each time which forces a taunt swap. Players with this mechanic should huddle near melee by the active tank so they are in an ideal position to be freed with Spiderlings along with the now-entombed tank.\n\n## Video\n\n<figure>\n  <Video src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlK8b8---KQ\" />\n</figure>\n",

Upon expiration these spawn pillars of the same name that pulsate raid damage until destroyed. These should be placed in line with the primary tank position, or very close together but not stacked (splashing your debuff-mates), and *not in melee*.\n\n  <Alert type=\"warning\">\n  This goes out at the same time as [Rock Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=380487). These players should focus on placing their pillar in the correct spot and not soaking.\n</Alert>\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={381576} name=\"Seismic Assault\" caption=\"Pillar-dying DoT\">\n  Killing a pillar causes [Seismic Assault](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381576), dealing 24k\n  damage to the entire raid and applying a DoT for 12 seconds, stacking.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={377166} name=\"Resonating Annihilation\" caption=\"Pizza-slice Frontal\">\n  When Terros reaches 100 energy he casts a pizza-slice frontal which permanently covers a quarter\n  of the platform in miasma. It deals lethal (478k nature) damage to those caught in it, destroying\n  [Awakened Earth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381486) pillars in the process, and causes\n  [Fractured Rubble](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=378861) to fall from the ceiling which deals\n  impact damage and leaving behind miasma.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={383073} name=\"Shattering Impact\" caption=\"Swirly on Largest Player Clump\">\n  Terros periodically casts [Shattering Impact](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383073) as a large yellow circle which, if caught within, deals 252k nature damage and knocks players into the air. This mechanic also triggers [Fractured Rubble](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=378861) to fall from the ceiling.\n\nTesting suggests the mechanic targets the largest clump of players, which is typically melee due to the ranged players dealing with pillar mechanics.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={376279} name=\"Concussive Slam\" caption=\"Tank Laser Beam\">\n  Terros will emit a line of energy at the active tank that deals 242k physical damage and increases damage taken by 30% for 45 seconds, stacking. [Concussive Slam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=376279) will destroy any [Awakened Earth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381486) pillars in the path of the beam.\n\nIn the same spirit as Halondrus, the beam is used to break pillars.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={377505} name=\"Frenzied Devastation\" caption=\"Soft Enrage\">\n  If the entire platform is filled with [Resonant Aftermath](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=382458)\n  puddles then Terros enrages, casting [Frenzied Devastation](https://www.wowhad.com/spell=377505)\n  repeatedly until our faces are melted off.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={388393} name=\"Tectonic Barrage\" caption=\"Lonely Boss Screeching\">\n  If no player is within the bosses range he will cast [Tectonic\n  Barrage](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=388393) repeatedly.\n</Mechanic>\n\n## Heroic Strategy\n\n<Alert type=\"warning\">\n\nThis normal and heroic strategy is outdated. Everyone stacks in melee and all pillars go right-ish so they're all broken at the same time from now on.\n\n</Alert>\n\nPositioning matters but isn't the key to this fight. The boss periodically drops rocks that spawn miasma on the platform which would complicate rigid position assignments. Ensuring pillars are in a cohesive line for tanks to break is the only real requirement.\n\n<figure>\n  <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/terros-rp-1.jpg\" width=\"1394\" height=\"500\" alt=\"\" />\n  <figcaption>The room is circular, but the RaidPlan is cropped for space.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe fight is based around a triangular formation for the ranged players. Ranged players will stack at <Marker type=\"diamond\" />. Melee and the off-tank should always be to the left of the current tank to avoid the [Concussive Slam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=376279) beam.\n\n1. Players debuffed with [Rock Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=380487) move to <Marker type=\"star\" />. The ranged and melee groups will dip into the outer edge of the circle to help soak.\n2. Players debuffed with [Awakened Earth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381486) move to <Marker type=\"skull\" /> and spread their circles in a line so the tank's beam mechanic can hit them all in one go.\n\nAt 100 energy when the boss casts [Resonating Annihilation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377166) the group will gateway out of the pizza slice. There are various similar abilities such as [Fractured Rubble](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=378861) which can also disrupt the group's positioning. Regardless, after movement the groups should best recreate the general positions they were in before, absent the markers. Think of the movement like Skolex, and the pillars and tank beam like Halondrus.\n\n## Video\n\n<figure>\n  <Video src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3koEFj75lkQ\" />\n  <figcaption>\n    The video does not show the players placing or breaking pillars in a consistent pattern.

      "raw": "\nSennarth 🕸️ is the first interesting boss in my opinion. Featuring a peculiar corkscrew room, heavy movement mechanics, and lots of little ways choose how to interact with the fight.\n\n## Mechanics\n\nRefer to [MythicTrap — Sennarth](https://www.mythictrap.com/en/vault/sennarth) for detailed visuals and animations of the mechanics. They have been listed here for absolutely no reason, at all.\n\n### Phase 1\n\n<Mechanic id={372765} name=\"Breath of Ice\" caption=\"Ice Patches\">\n  Sennarth spits out a bunch of [Icy Ground](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372765?dd=15) patches\n  that deal 19,273 damage per second to players standing in them and causing them to *slide around*.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={371976} name=\"Chilling Blast\" caption=\"DoT, Spread\">\n  Sennarth debuffs several players, dealing 35,334 damage every second for 5 seconds and causing\n  [Frost Expulsion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371979) upon expiration, dealing 108,103 frost\n  damage to all other players within 4 yards.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={372082} name=\"Enveloping Webs\" caption=\"Miasma-Bombing DoT\">\n  \nSennarth inflicts 19,200 physical damage to several players and causes them to drop [Sticky Webbing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372030) on the ground every second for 6 seconds.\n\nPlayers with this debuff should continue moving to avoid bombarding themselves with [Sticky Webbing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372030) stacks. Gaining 10 stacks of this debuff will entomb the player with [Wrapped in Webs](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372044). However, standing in [Sticky Webbing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372030) will prevent the player from being gripped off the platform by [Gossamer Burst](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373405).\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={373405} name=\"Gossamer Burst\" caption=\"Grip Off Platform\">\n  Sennarth inflicts 156,211 damage to the raid and attaches webs to every player. After a short delay she will rapidly attempt to pull everyone off of the platform to their death.\n\nClasses that have immunities to movement impairing effects, teleports, or high-speed movement can run against the mechanic and use their utility. Everyone else, or players focusing on their damage, can step into [Sticky Webbing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372030) until the effect ends and they will not move at all.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={372736} name=\"Permafrost\" caption=\"Old Platforms Deadly\">\n  The boss deals 6,424 frost damage every second, stacking, to players who remain on platforms she\n  has left. If we leave an entombed player behind they'll die to this before the webbing falls off.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={385083} name=\"Web Blast\" caption=\"Tank Swap\">\n  Standard tank swap ability, recommended to swap at 5-8 stacks.\n</Mechanic>\n\n#### Frostbreath Arachnid\n\nThis is a tanked add which spawns once per platform that should be focused down.\n\n<Mechanic id={374112} name=\"Freezing Breath\" caption=\"Frontal Cone\">\n  This is the same as the boss ability, [Breath of Ice](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372765) only\n  with a frontal component. Tanks just need to keep it facing away from the raid.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={373817} name=\"Chilling Aura\" caption=\"Ramping Raid Damage\">\n  While the Frostbreath Arachnid is alive it will pulse 36,039 frost damage to the raid, and increases the damage done by this ability by 20% every time it deals damage. This damage is not avoidable, so the add should be focused down.\n\nThe spider also physically grows in size, which is horrifying.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n#### Caustic Spiderlings\n\n<Mechanic\n  id={372045}\n  name=\"Caustic Eruption\"\n  caption=\"Removes webbing and frees web-trapped players\"\n>\n  Killing a Caustic Spiderling causes it to pop, dealing 48,065 splash damage to players within 5\n  yards. Notably, this explosion also removes [Sticky Webbing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372030)\n  from the ground *and* player as well as freeing anyone [Wrapped in\n  Webs](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372044).\n\nThey do have an aggro table, but their health is low enough that they are likely to die to random cleave damage. This has the benefit of removing webbing from the platform randomly, but if a player is entombed tanks should be prepared to herd a spider to the player to free them.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n### Phase 2\n\n<Mechanic id={372540} name=\"Apex of Ice\" caption=\"Interrupt\">\n  Phase 2 trigger mechanic that Sennarth starts channeling when she reaches the final platform. This\n  permanently covers the platform in [Ice Patch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372765) and deals\n  increasing raid damage until she is interrupted. This should be interrupted as soon as possible.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={372648} name=\"Pervasive Cold\" caption=\"Soft Enrage Vulnerability\">\n  Players are increasingly vulnerable to frost damage on the final platform.

It is more\ndangerous now as you will also slide backward because of the ice on the platform, making it easy for\nplayers to be pushed into a [Glacial Plume](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373559) which can easily\nkill them.\n\nThis can still be negated with [Sticky Webbing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372030).\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={373048} name=\"Suffocating Webs\" caption=\"Enveloping Webs v2.0\">\n\nSennarth cheats and casts [Enveloping Webs](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372082) but will only drop [Sticky Webbing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372030) at the end of the debuff as well as knocking back the player and instantly entombing them.\n\nThis will only target the active tank.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n## Mythic Changes\n\n- [Sticky Webbing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372030) now slows you by 35% per stack (was 25%), lasts 1 minute (was 30 seconds), and entombs you at 8 stacks (was 10). Standing in the webs themselves still only does minor damage.\n- Sennarth has a new phase 1 mechanic [Gusting Rime](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396792) which spawns tornadoes. Getting hit knocks you up and back as well as dealing `96,367` frost damage.\n- The Caustic Spiderling's [Caustic Eruption](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372045) now applies a stacking 300% vulnerability to the explosion for 30 seconds called [Dissolved Defenses](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=388016). A standard hit deals `64,244` nature damage on mythic, and a single stack of the vulnerability will deal `192,732` nature damage, likely lethal in combination with other mechanics.\n- The ramps start covered in [Icy Ground](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372765) in addition to the new tornadoes.\n\n## Mythic Strategy\n\nThe approach to phase 1 is the same as heroic, however, we haven't experienced the phase 2 mechanics since she has been dying too fast. The \"intermission\" ramps being covered in ice make it a bit more dangerous so gateways will be used strategically to spend as little time on them as possible.\n\n### Phase 1 — Platforms\n\nGiven the bosses' proclivity toward spewing ice patches haphazardly in addition to there now being tornadoes, the only recommendation for the platforms is to be aware of where you need to be next. For instance, if you're a melee don't be caught too close to the boss with a tornado behind you just before the pull starts and no webs or movement ability. Similarly, if you wait around on the platform for too long and gateway just before [Chilling Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371976) finishes you could yourself and others killed.\n\n<Alert type=\"warning\">\n\nThe Frostbreath Arachnid add is still a priority target while it is alive. Not cleave, priority.\n\n</Alert>\n\n### Phase 1 — \"Intermission\" Ramps\n\nWarlock gateways will be placed at the cusp of each of the three ramps to their middle and we will [Stampeding Roar](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=77764) the rest of the way to the platform. Each ramp will have a different combination of [Chilling Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371976), [Gossamer Burst](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373405), and [Enveloping Webs](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372082) mechanic timings.\n\n- **Ramp 1** — When Sennarth starts to ascend to the second platform the raid will wait for the [Chilling Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371976) spread mechanic to finish then we all immediately use the gateway. She then casts [Gossamer Burst](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373405) and grips us just as we finish ascending the ramp. There is a rock at the top of this ramp that is a safe spot to stand for the grip.\n\n  <div className=\"flex justify-center\">\n    <figure>\n      <ProseImage\n        src=\"/images/strategies/vault/sennarth-ramp1-pillar.jpg\"\n        height=\"840\"\n        width=\"445\"\n        alt=\"\"\n      />\n      <figcaption>\n        They are using <Marker type=\"moon\" /> to stack after reaching the platform.\n      </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n  </div>\n\n- **Ramp 2** — As she ascends the second ramp, the raid will wait for the [Enveloping Webs](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372082) cast to go out then everyone but those two players use the gateway. She will cast [Chilling Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371976) during the gateway and everyone will immediately spread to avoid hitting each other with their circles. There is another rock with a safe spot to stand for the grip. Knockbacks are needed to prevent the Caustic Spiderlings from standing, and dying, on top of the raid during the grip.\n\n  <Alert type=\"info\">\n\n  The players with [Enveloping Webs](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372082) should wait on the platform because the slowing component of the ice on the ramp will ensure they're hit by their webs as they drop. They should also pop a personal for the [Chilling Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371976) because they will likely be out of range of the healers, then they can gateway.\n\n  </Alert>\n\n<div className=\"flex justify-center\">\n  <figure>\n    <ProseImage\n      src=\"/images/strategies/vault/sennarth-ramp2-pillar.jpg\"\n      height=\"840\"\n      width=\"445\"\n      alt=\"\"\n    />\n    <figcaption>This marker is closer to the ramp than the prior rock stack point.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n\n- **Ramp 3**  — The third ramp is similar to the second with the gateway \"trigger mechanic\" being [Enveloping Webs](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372082) once again. Those two remain on the platform until the webbing stops while everyone else is spreading for [Chilling Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371976). The next mechanic is the [Gossamer Burst](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373405) grip, however, the pillar is considered unsafe to hide behind. Thankfully the grip is delayed in comparison to other ramps, so everyone has plenty of time to disengage from the boss and get to the back of the platform.\n\n### Phase 2\n\nThe second phase modifies a few mechanics that I'll reiterate as we've never experienced them on Heroic aside from the obvious ice covering the platform:\n\n- [Chilling Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371976) leaves behind [Glacial Plume](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373559) bombs. They deal `128,489` frost damage and knockbacks anyone hit.\n- [Suffocating Webs](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373048) replaces [Enveloping Webs](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372082). After 6 seconds the player spawns a single web, is knocked back and entombed. A tank is guaranteed to get this, and maybe 1 other person.\n- [Repelling Burst](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371983) replaces [Gossamer Burst](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373405) and does a pushback instead of a pull.\n- [Pervasive Cold](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372648) increases frost damage by 10% the longer we're on the platform. This is a generalized soft-enrage mechanic.\n\nThe execution is simple — we spread to the sides of the platform for [Chilling Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371976), leaving the central line with the boss clear of bombs. Otherwise, we stack in front of the boss for the pushback. You can still use the [Sticky Webbing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372030) dropped by the tank to avoid the pushback from the [Repelling Burst](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371983) because getting back in position is more annoying because of the platform ice. After each pushback, the boss will be moved forward so that we can repeat the process with open sides for bomb placement.\n\n<figure>\n  <ProseImage\n    src=\"/images/strategies/vault/sennarth-rp-1.webp\"\n    height=\"784\"\n    width=\"1394\"\n    alt=\"\"\n    quality=\"100\"\n  />\n  <figcaption>\n    If we're not spreading for bombs then we're stacked in front of the boss for healing and the\n    pushback.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure>\n  <ProseImage\n    src=\"/images/strategies/vault/sennarth-rp-3.webp\"\n    height=\"784\"\n    width=\"1394\"\n    alt=\"\"\n    quality=\"100\"\n  />\n  <figcaption>\n    Everyone spreads with [Chilling Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371976) while leaving the\n    center of the platform free.

They have been listed here for reference.\n\n<Mechanic id={380487} name=\"Rock Blast\" caption=\"Split-meteor mechanic\">\n\nA random player is targeted with a swirling vortex meteor mechanic. It deals 961k nature damage\nsplit evenly among players within 12 yards and leaves an [Aftershock](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=386400) which erupts at the impact location a few seconds later.\n\n<Alert type=\"warning\">\n  This goes out at the same time as [Awakened Earth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381486).\n</Alert>\n<Alert>This mechanic can be solo'd with immunities. 🐢</Alert>\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={381486} name=\"Awakened Earth\" caption=\"Pillars\">\n  Several players are debuffed with [Awakened Earth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381486), marking them with a yellow arrow and surrounding them with a small circle. Upon expiration these spawn pillars of the same name that pulsate raid damage until destroyed. These should be placed in line with the primary tank position, or very close together but not stacked (splashing your debuff-mates), and *not in melee*.\n\n  <Alert type=\"warning\">\n  This goes out at the same time as [Rock Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=380487). These players should focus on placing their pillar in the correct spot and not soaking.\n</Alert>\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={381576} name=\"Seismic Assault\" caption=\"Pillar-dying DoT\">\n  Killing a pillar causes [Seismic Assault](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381576), dealing 24k\n  damage to the entire raid and applying a DoT for 12 seconds, stacking.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={377166} name=\"Resonating Annihilation\" caption=\"Pizza-slice Frontal\">\n  When Terros reaches 100 energy he casts a pizza-slice frontal which permanently covers a quarter\n  of the platform in miasma. It deals lethal (478k nature) damage to those caught in it, destroying\n  [Awakened Earth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381486) pillars in the process, and causes\n  [Fractured Rubble](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=378861) to fall from the ceiling which deals\n  impact damage and leaving behind miasma.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={383073} name=\"Shattering Impact\" caption=\"Swirly on Largest Player Clump\">\n  Terros periodically casts [Shattering Impact](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383073) as a large yellow circle which, if caught within, deals 252k nature damage and knocks players into the air. This mechanic also triggers [Fractured Rubble](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=378861) to fall from the ceiling.\n\nTesting suggests the mechanic targets the largest clump of players, which is typically melee due to the ranged players dealing with pillar mechanics.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={376279} name=\"Concussive Slam\" caption=\"Tank Laser Beam\">\n  Terros will emit a line of energy at the active tank that deals 242k physical damage and increases damage taken by 30% for 45 seconds, stacking. [Concussive Slam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=376279) will destroy any [Awakened Earth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381486) pillars in the path of the beam.\n\nIn the same spirit as Halondrus, the beam is used to break pillars.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={396351} name=\"Infused Fallout\" caption=\"Clearable DoT\" pill=\"Mythic\">\n\nOn Mythic, Terros will periodically debuff everyone with [Infused Fallout](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396351), dealing 9k ticking damage every second until cleared. It can be cleared by touching another player with the debuff, but doing so causes [Explosive Reaction](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391322), dealing 16k damage to the raid for every debuff removed. Furthermore, shortly thereafter [Reactive Bedrock](https://wowhead.com/spell=394347) erupts from the ground dealing 256k damage to anyone hit.\n\n<Alert type=\"info\">\n\nThe pillars are fast! Keep moving.\n\n</Alert>\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={377505} name=\"Frenzied Devastation\" caption=\"Soft Enrage\">\n  If the entire platform is filled with [Resonant Aftermath](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=382458)\n  puddles then Terros enrages, casting [Frenzied Devastation](https://www.wowhad.com/spell=377505)\n  repeatedly until our faces are melted off.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={388393} name=\"Tectonic Barrage\" caption=\"Lonely Boss Screeching\">\n  If no player is within the bosses range he will cast [Tectonic\n  Barrage](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=388393) repeatedly.\n</Mechanic>\n\n## Strategy\n\n### Changes\n\nThere are two changes to the fight on mythic:\n\n1. [Rock Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=380487), or the meteor soaking mechanic, no longer splits damage across those soaking but instead deals damage to the entire raid, lowered by the number of people soaking. With everyone soaking both versions of the mechanic have the same result. However, if you don't soak on mythic you are still hit anyway and everyone will take more damage because of it.\n2. [Infused Fallout](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396351) is a DoT that Terros applies to the entire raid that will deal ticking damage until cleared ala touching someone else with the DoT. Unsurprisingly, doing so causes the raid to take `16,061` nature damage per stack cleared, and shortly after [Reactive Bedrock](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=394347) pillars erupt from where the DoTs were cleared, dealing `256,978` nature damage to anyone hit.\n\n   He casts this after every [Shattering Impact](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383073), or the big yellow circle we bait and dodge, and [Resonating Annihilation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377166), the pizza slice that deletes a quarter of the room.\n\n### Strategy\n\nThere are two pillars (teehee) to the strategy:\n\n1. Breaking all of the pillars at the same time using the first [Concussive Slam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=376279). This is because the second [Concussive Slam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=376279) occurs after [Infused Fallout](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396351) and leaving pillars up makes the burst of damage from clearing these debuffs more dangerous.\n2. Stacking most of the raid during [Infused Fallout](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396351) to immediately clear the debuffs barring a few select ranged as everyone clearing at once is too much damage.\n\nThe fight is scripted and callouts will be generously provided, so if any of the following is confusing I recommend watching the provided kill videos to get a better idea of the movement.\n\n#### Fight Cadence\n\nThese are the mechanics and their order for every pie slice:\n\n1. Soak — [Rock Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=380487)\n2. Pillar Break 1 — [Concussive Slam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=376279)\n3. Dodge Big Circle — [Shattering Impact](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383073)\n4. Clear Debuffs — [Infused Fallout](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396351)\n5. Pillar Break 2 (Backup) — [Concussive Slam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=376279)\n6. Repeat 1-5 one more time.\n7. Pie Slice — [Resonating Annihilation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377166)\n8. Clear Debuffs — [Infused Fallout](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396351)\n\nEach mechanic has a specific way of dealing with it. Aside from dodging things, these are the three big orchestrated movements:\n\n- Always soak the [Rock Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=380487) unless you have a pillar debuff and need to place it outside of the circle to keep it in line with the other pillars.\n- When we're baiting [Shattering Impact](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383073) everyone will be stacked in melee except for 4 (?) ranged. These chosen ranged will be far enough from melee so their [Fractured Rubble](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=378861) miasma isn't in the way, and spread from each other so that they don't clear their [Infused Fallout](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396351) debuffs until told to.\n- Always dodge the [Shattering Impact](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383073) _to the right_ because [Fractured Rubble](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=378861) will spawn under us afterward. We want to bait the miasma away from the direction we're moving. The raid will then move back to the left to avoid the rubble.\n\n### Example\n\nHere is an example of fight placement for one round of mechanics.\n\n<Tabs>\n\n  <Tab label=\"Part 1\">\n  \n    <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/terros-rp-1.png\" width=\"1394\" height=\"500\" alt=\"\" />\n\n    Everyone helps soak the [Rock Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=380487). The people with pillars form a central line as it's a lot easier to tell where to go if it's just \"in the middle\", and so people can more easily get away from the pillars without getting stuck.\n\n    It's acceptable for 1-2 of the people with pillars to be outside of the circle if it helps maintain a line for the tanks. Everyone else should be inside the circle.\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab label=\"Part 2\">\n    \n    <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/terros-rp-2.png\" width=\"1394\" height=\"500\" alt=\"\" />\n\n    Dodge the aftershock after soaking.\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab label=\"Part 3\">\n    \n    <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/terros-rp-3.png\" width=\"1394\" height=\"500\" alt=\"\" />\n\n    The tanks will then break all of the pillars.\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab label=\"Part 4\">\n    \n    <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/terros-rp-4.png\" width=\"1394\" height=\"500\" alt=\"\" />\n\n    After the pillars are broken the raid will stack together to bait the [Shattering Impact](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383073) except for any ranged assigned not to.\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab label=\"Part 5\">\n    \n    <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/terros-rp-5.png\" width=\"1394\" height=\"500\" alt=\"\" />\n\n    The raid dodges the [Shattering Impact](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383073).\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab label=\"Part 6\">\n    \n    <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/terros-rp-6.png\" width=\"1394\" height=\"500\" alt=\"\" />\n\n    The raid then moves to the left to avoid the [Fractured Rubble](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=378861) miasma, back where we started when baiting for the [Shattering Impact](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383073).\n\n    After this, either another [Rock Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=380487) will be coming for the raid to soak or it's pie-slice time.\n\n  </Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n## Videos\n\n<figure>\n  <Video src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzMDOuzcHJQ\" />\n  <figcaption>\n    This kill video clearly shows proper pillar placement and movements for [Shattering\n    Impact](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383073) and the resulting [Fractured\n    Rubble](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=378861).\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure>\n  <Video src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2EAF42jtqM\" />\n  <figcaption>\n    Stankie explains the mechanics better than they execute them in the video.
