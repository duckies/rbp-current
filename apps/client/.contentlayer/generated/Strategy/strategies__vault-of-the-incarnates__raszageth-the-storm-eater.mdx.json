One thing we ignored in normal is that these debuffs deal falloff damage.\n\n    The raid will be central, ideally within the golden area of the platform. The 3 players with the [Static Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381615) debuffs need to quickly coordinate so 1 of them is placed behind the group (<Marker type=\"star\" />) and the other 2 are spread to the farther reaches of the platform (<Marker type=\"diamond\" />, <Marker type=\"triangle\" />).\n\n    Lastly, the adds spawned from [Volatile Current](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=388643) now need to be interrupted twice.\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab label=\"Intermission 1\">\n    <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/raszageth-rp-2.png\" height=\"784\" width=\"1394\" alt=\"\" />\n\n    The first intermission is not notably different. The ruiner adds will periodically give players a circle they have to run out with, and the acolytes get a large haste buff at low health. Don't ignore acolytes and move on to the next ruiner as it will be much harder to interrupt [Storm Bolt](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=385553) if they have the haste buff.\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab label=\"Phase 2\">\n    <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/raszageth-rp-3.png\" height=\"784\" width=\"1394\" alt=\"\" />\n\n    The \"Thaddius marks\" in this phase are now more like \"Anduin marks\" where players of the wrong charge touching will zap each other in quick succession. The mechanic is simple to execute, but may take some practice:\n\n    1. Shortly before the shield begins everyone will spread around the golden circle of the platform. This doesn't mean vaguely spread in a semicircle I mean truly circumnavigating the platform.\n    2. Players with negative charges will move first, and quickly, to the center of the ring and stack on <Marker type=\"cross\" />.\n    3. The remaining positively charged players will then stack on <Marker type=\"square\" />.\n\n    The other mechanics are seen in the first phase with the exception of the large, jumping debuff circle [Fulimating Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377467), but is not different on Heroic.\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab label=\"Intermission 2\">\n    <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/raszageth-rp-4.png\" height=\"784\" width=\"1394\" alt=\"\" />\n\n    The second intermission has double the fun compared to normal. Two of the Colossal Stormfiends will spawn and they spawn stormlings underneath them that try to reach the opposite Stormfiend.They need to be killed somewhat evenly or the surviving Stormfiend will gain a stacking enrage effect every 2 seconds.\n\n    Don't forget that Raszageth continues to breathe on the platform.\n\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab label=\"Phase 3\">\n    <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/raszageth-rp-5.png\" height=\"784\" width=\"1394\" alt=\"\" />\n\n    The last phase is made interesting by [Magnetic Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=399713). A player is selected that will grip everyone to their location after 8 seconds. This also does falloff damage, so the player should be vaguely at another cardinal direction that the raid isn't at on the central ring of the platform without placing everyone in the encroaching miasma.\n\n    Other mechanics such as the tank's [Thunderous Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=386410) and [Tempest Wing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=385574) may require more consideration.
