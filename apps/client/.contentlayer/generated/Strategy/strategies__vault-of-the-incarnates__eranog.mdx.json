    "raw": "\nEranog is a nondescript boss with some occasional add cleave. He has a main phase that consists of âœ¨ _hitting him_ âœ¨, and killing adds that spawn from a debuff he applies to a few players. When he hits 100 energy he casts an intermission mechanic where we have to create a safe space similar to Painsmith Raznal's [Spiked Balls](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=352052).\n\n## Mechanics\n\nRefer to [MythicTrap â€” Eranog](https://www.mythictrap.com/en/vault/eranog/heroic) for detailed visuals and animations of the mechanics. They have been listed here in brief for reference.\n\n<Mechanic id={390715} name=\"Flamerift\" caption=\"Debuff that spawns miasma and a fixating add\">\n  Several players will be periodically debuffed with\n  [Flamerift](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=390715/flamerift&ddsize=25). Upon expiration, affected\n  players will deal damage within 4 yards, leave a [Lava\n  Flow](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=370649/lava-flow) puddle, and spawn a *Flamescale Tarasek* add\n  that will fixate a random player.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={370615} name=\"Molten Cleave\" caption=\"Frontal aimed at a random player\">\n  Eranog will periodically cast [Molten\n  Cleave](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=370615/molten-cleave?&ddsize=25) at a random player, dealing\n  damage to all players in the cone aimed at the target.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={396022} name=\"Molten Spikes\" caption=\"Pillars\">\n  [Molten Spike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396022) pillars will spawn near the boss, dealing\n  moderate damage to those caught in their spawn and knocking them back. On Heroic, the spikes\n  explode into lines of [Molten Fissure](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396031) circles when the boss\n  casts [Incinerating Roar](https://en.wowhead.com/spell=396023).\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic\n  id={396023}\n  name=\"Incinerating Roar\"\n  caption=\"Burst of AoE damage, applies DoT, explodes pillars\"\n>\n  Eranog screeches, dealing damage to all players and applying a DoT that stacks with each cast.\n  This will also destroy any active [Molten Spikes](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396022).\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={370307} name=\"Army of Flame\" caption=\"Enclosing ring of adds\">\n  At full energy Eranog will run to the center of the room to cast [Army of\n  Flame](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=370307). A circle of Primal Flame elementals will spawn at\n  the edges of the room and walk towards the center. Anyone hit by the ring will be\n  [Incinerated](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373327/incinerate?&ddsize=30), taking lethal fire\n  damage, and will be stunned for 3 seconds if survived. The raid will have to focus down one of the\n  elementals to create safe passage through the ring while also healing through [Pulsing\n  Flames](https://en.wowhead.com/spell=370410) while the intermission is active.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={394904} name=\"Burning Wound\" caption=\"Tank-swap DoT\">\n  Standard stacking tank-swap mechanic. Swap at 2 stacks.\n</Mechanic>\n\n## Strategy\n\n### Phase 1\n\nThe first phase is a tank and spank with us staying near the boss to optimize space and add cleave. [Lava\nFlow](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=370649/lava-flow) puddles from [Flamerift](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=390715/flamerift?&ddsize=25) and [Molten Spikes](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396022) will prompt the tanks to move the boss clockwise around the room to avoid them. Everything else is a function of dodging.\n\n<Alert type=\"warning\">\n  Straying too far from the group will annoy healers and will prevent cleaving the Flamescale\n  Tarasek adds if [Flamerift](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=390715/flamerift?&ddsize=25) is\n  misplaced. ðŸ˜ \n</Alert>\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab label=\"01. Fight Start\">\n    When the fight starts we will pull the boss towards the platform ring and remain loosely clumped together.\n    <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/eranog-rp-1.png\" width=\"1394\" height=\"784\" alt=\"\" />\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab label=\"02. Flamerift Movement\">\n    After dealing with [Flamerift](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=390715), the boss will be moved clockwise to get away from the lava. That's kinda it!\n    <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/eranog-rp-2.png\" width=\"1394\" height=\"784\" alt=\"\" />\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n### Intermission\n\nDuring the intermission we will focus down whichever Primal Flame add is closest to us. Pop personals and stay in the healing effects as the secondary effect of this intermission is raid damage.\n\n<ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/eranog-rp-3.png\" width=\"1394\" height=\"784\" alt=\"\" />\n\n## Video\n\nThis video isn't two minutes long and shows the three-ish mechanics of consequence in this fight.\n\n<Video src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE4QO3FX0Ug\" />\n",
