Furthermore, shortly thereafter [Reactive Bedrock](https://wowhead.com/spell=394347) erupts from the ground dealing 256k damage to anyone hit.\n\n<Alert type=\"info\">\n\nThe pillars are fast!

[Rock Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=380487), or the meteor soaking mechanic, no longer splits damage across those soaking but instead deals damage to the entire raid, lowered by the number of people soaking. With everyone soaking both versions of the mechanic have the same result. However, if you don't soak on mythic you are still hit anyway and everyone will take more damage because of it.\n2. [Infused Fallout](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396351) is a DoT that Terros applies to the entire raid that will deal ticking damage until cleared ala touching someone else with the DoT. Unsurprisingly, doing so causes the raid to take `16,061` nature damage per stack cleared, and shortly after [Reactive Bedrock](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=394347) pillars erupt from where the DoTs were cleared, dealing `256,978` nature damage to anyone hit.\n\n   He casts this after every [Shattering Impact](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383073), or the big yellow circle we bait and dodge, and [Resonating Annihilation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377166), the pizza slice that deletes a quarter of the room.\n\n### Strategy\n\nThere are two pillars (teehee) to the strategy:\n\n1. Breaking all of the pillars at the same time using the first [Concussive Slam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=376279). This is because the second [Concussive Slam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=376279) occurs after [Infused Fallout](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396351) and leaving pillars up makes the burst of damage from clearing these debuffs more dangerous.\n2. Stacking most of the raid during [Infused Fallout](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396351) to immediately clear the debuffs barring a few select ranged as everyone clearing at once is too much damage.\n\nThe fight is scripted and callouts will be generously provided, so if any of the following is confusing I recommend watching the provided kill videos to get a better idea of the movement.\n\n#### Fight Cadence\n\nThese are the mechanics and their order for every pie slice:\n\n1. Soak ‚Äî [Rock Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=380487)\n2. Pillar Break 1 ‚Äî [Concussive Slam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=376279)\n3. Dodge Big Circle ‚Äî [Shattering Impact](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383073)\n4. Clear Debuffs ‚Äî [Infused Fallout](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396351)\n5. Pillar Break 2 (Backup) ‚Äî [Concussive Slam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=376279)\n6. Repeat 1-5 one more time.\n7. Pie Slice ‚Äî [Resonating Annihilation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377166)\n8. Clear Debuffs ‚Äî [Infused Fallout](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396351)\n\nEach mechanic has a specific way of dealing with it. Aside from dodging things, these are the three big orchestrated movements:\n\n- Always soak the [Rock Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=380487) unless you have a pillar debuff and need to place it outside of the circle to keep it in line with the other pillars.\n- When we're baiting [Shattering Impact](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383073) everyone will be stacked in melee except for 4 (?) ranged. These chosen ranged will be far enough from melee so their [Fractured Rubble](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=378861) miasma isn't in the way, and spread from each other so that they don't clear their [Infused Fallout](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396351) debuffs until told to.\n- Always dodge the [Shattering Impact](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383073) _to the right_ because [Fractured Rubble](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=378861) will spawn under us afterward. We want to bait the miasma away from the direction we're moving. The raid will then move back to the left to avoid the rubble.\n\n### Example\n\nHere is an example of fight placement for one round of mechanics.\n\n<Tabs>\n\n  <Tab label=\"Part 1\">\n  \n    <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/terros-rp-1.png\" width=\"1394\" height=\"500\" alt=\"\" />\n\n    Everyone helps soak the [Rock Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=380487). The people with pillars form a central line as it's a lot easier to tell where to go if it's just \"in the middle\", and so people can more easily get away from the pillars without getting stuck.\n\n    It's acceptable for 1-2 of the people with pillars to be outside of the circle if it helps maintain a line for the tanks. Everyone else should be inside the circle.\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab label=\"Part 2\">\n    \n    <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/terros-rp-2.png\" width=\"1394\" height=\"500\" alt=\"\" />\n\n    Dodge the aftershock after soaking.\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab label=\"Part 3\">\n    \n    <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/terros-rp-3.png\" width=\"1394\" height=\"500\" alt=\"\" />\n\n    The tanks will then break all of the pillars.\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab label=\"Part 4\">\n    \n    <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/terros-rp-4.png\" width=\"1394\" height=\"500\" alt=\"\" />\n\n    After the pillars are broken the raid will stack together to bait the [Shattering Impact](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383073) except for any ranged assigned not to.\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab label=\"Part 5\">\n    \n    <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/terros-rp-5.png\" width=\"1394\" height=\"500\" alt=\"\" />\n\n    The raid dodges the [Shattering Impact](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383073).\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab label=\"Part 6\">\n    \n    <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/terros-rp-6.png\" width=\"1394\" height=\"500\" alt=\"\" />\n\n    The raid then moves to the left to avoid the [Fractured Rubble](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=378861) miasma, back where we started when baiting for the [Shattering Impact](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383073).\n\n    After this, either another [Rock Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=380487) will be coming for the raid to soak or it's pie-slice time.\n\n  </Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n## Videos\n\n<figure>\n  <Video src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzMDOuzcHJQ\" />\n  <figcaption>\n    This kill video clearly shows proper pillar placement and movements for [Shattering\n    Impact](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383073) and the resulting [Fractured\n    Rubble](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=378861).\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure>\n  <Video src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2EAF42jtqM\" />\n  <figcaption>\n    Stankie explains the mechanics better than they execute them in the video. They are\n    inappropriately spread throughout much of the video which leads to miasma all over the place.\n    Once you understand the mechanics look at the previous video for a better example of how they\n    should be executed.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</Difficulty>\n\n<Difficulty normal heroic>\n\n## Heroic Strategy\n\n<Alert type=\"warning\">\n\nThis normal and heroic strategy is outdated. Everyone stacks in melee and all pillars go right-ish so they're all broken at the same time from now on.\n\n</Alert>\n\nPositioning matters but isn't the key to this fight. The boss periodically drops rocks that spawn miasma on the platform which would complicate rigid position assignments. Ensuring pillars are in a cohesive line for tanks to break is the only real requirement.\n\n<figure>\n  <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/terros-rp-1.jpg\" width=\"1394\" height=\"500\" alt=\"\" />\n  <figcaption>The room is circular, but the RaidPlan is cropped for space.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe fight is based around a triangular formation for the ranged players. Ranged players will stack at <Marker type=\"diamond\" />. Melee and the off-tank should always be to the left of the current tank to avoid the [Concussive Slam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=376279) beam.\n\n1. Players debuffed with [Rock Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=380487) move to <Marker type=\"star\" />. The ranged and melee groups will dip into the outer edge of the circle to help soak.\n2. Players debuffed with [Awakened Earth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381486) move to <Marker type=\"skull\" /> and spread their circles in a line so the tank's beam mechanic can hit them all in one go.\n\nAt 100 energy when the boss casts [Resonating Annihilation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377166) the group will gateway out of the pizza slice. There are various similar abilities such as [Fractured Rubble](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=378861) which can also disrupt the group's positioning. Regardless, after movement the groups should best recreate the general positions they were in before, absent the markers. Think of the movement like Skolex, and the pillars and tank beam like Halondrus.\n\n## Video\n\n<figure>\n  <Video src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3koEFj75lkQ\" />\n  <figcaption>\n    The video does not show the players placing or breaking pillars in a consistent pattern. The\n    specifics of movement and positioning are not important, just get a feel for what the mechanics\n    look like.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</Difficulty>\n",
