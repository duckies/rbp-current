    "raw": "\nAs one of the earlier encounters, this is yet another simple fight. There are none of the usual phase-based mechanics you see with other council fights, just a lot of cleave.\n\n## Mechanics\n\nRefer to [Mythic Trap â€” The Primal Council](https://www.mythictrap.com/en/vault/primalCouncil) for detailed visuals and animations of the mechanics. They have been listed here for reference.\n\n### Kadros Icewrath\n\n<Mechanic id={371836} name=\"Primal Blizzard\" caption=\"Stacking DoT, Cleared by Fire\">\n  Kadros will channel a freezing storm when reaching 100 energy, applying a stacking DoT that deals 4.8k Frost damage every second, increaes Frost damage taken by 10%, and reduces Fire damage by 10%, for 15 seconds.\n\nIf you reach 10 stacks you will be entombed in a [Frost Tomb](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371591?dd=15), dealing damage every second until freed. This debuff can be cleared by dipping into [Scorched Ground](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371514?dd=15).\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={372315} name=\"Frost Spike\" caption=\"Interruptable Frost Spell\">\n  An interruptable spell the boss casts that inflicts 48,065 frost damage.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={386440} name=\"Glacial Convocation\" caption=\"Death Knell Ability\">\n  Upon defeat, Kadros will channel [Glacial Convocation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=386440?dd=15)\n  until the other council members are defeated. This deals 48,065 frost damage to all players every\n  6 seconds, and increases over time.\n</Mechanic>\n\n### Dathea Stormlash\n\n<Mechanic id={371624} name=\"Conductive Mark\" caption=\"Ramping DoT, Rub Pillar to Remove\">\n  Dathea will apply [Conductive Mark](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371624?dd=15) to several players that deals 34,444 nature damage on impact and 15,455 nature damage every 2 seconds for 20 seconds. Each tick of the DoT increases nature damage taken by 8%.\n\nComing within 5 yards of another player will copy the effect onto the player. However, coming within 5 yards of an [Earthen Pillar](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=370991?dd=15) will remove the mark.\n\n  <Alert type=\"warning\">On Mythic, the mark is permanent and must be removed with a pillar.</Alert>\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={372394} name=\"Lightning Bolt\" caption=\"Interruptable Nature Spell\">\n  An interruptable spell the boss casts that inflicts 48,065 nature damage.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={372275} name=\"Chain Lightning\" caption=\"Arcing Random Damage\">\n  Inflicts 24,032 damage to a random player and arcs to other nearby players. Unavoidable healer\n  work.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={386375} name=\"Storming Convocation\" caption=\"Death Knell Ability\">\n  Upon defeat, Dathea will channel [Storming\n  Convocation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=386375?dd=15) until the other council members are\n  defeated. This deals 48,065 nature damage to all players every 6 seconds, and increases over time.\n</Mechanic>\n\n### Opalfang\n\n<Mechanic id={370991} name=\"Earthen Pillar\" caption=\"Pillars\">\n  Opalfang summons pillars under several players, dealing 120,162 nature damage and knocking players back if they are hit. Each pillar emits [Quacking Pulse](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396328?dd=15), dealing 2,403 nature damage every 2 seconds to the entire raid until destroyed with [Meteor Axes](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374038?dd=15).\n\nPlayers with [Conductive Mark](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371624?dd=15) can rub their body on the pillar to remove the debuff.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={372056} name=\"Crush\" caption=\"Tank Swap\">\n  Inflicts 240,325 physical damage to her current target and applies a 100% physical damage\n  vulnerability, stacking. This is a standard alternating tank swap.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={386370} name=\"Quaking Convocation\" caption=\"Death Knell Ability\">\n  Upon defeat, Opalfang will channel [Quaking\n  Convocation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=386370?dd=15) until the other council members are\n  defeated. This deals 48,065 nature damage to all players every 6 seconds, and increases over time.\n</Mechanic>\n\n### Embar Firepath\n\n<Mechanic id={374038} name=\"Meteor Axes\" caption=\"Meteor Soak with Alternating Groups\">\n  Embar targets 2 players and throws axes at them, inflicting 309,101 fire damage split between all targets within 10 yards of the targeted player and increases damage taken from [Meteor Axes](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374038?dd=15) by 300% for 15 seconds.\n\nThe axes are thrown in sequence, meaning both axes cannot be stacked as the second hit will be after the vulnerability is applied, so two separate soak groups are needed (melee, ranged). Each Axe spawns [Scorched Ground](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371514?dd=15) miasma which is used to clear [Primal Blizzard](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371836?dd=15) debuffs.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={372027} name=\"Slashing Blaze\" caption=\"Tank Frontal\">\n  Ember will cast a frontal cleave attack at 100 energy that deals 192,260 fire damage and an additional 48,065 damage every 1.5 seconds for 15 seconds, stacking.\n\n  <Alert type=\"warning\">Don't be in front of the boss or die.</Alert>\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={386289} name=\"Burning Convocation\" caption=\"Death Knell Ability\">\n  Upon defeat, Embar will channel [Burning Convocation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=386289?dd=15)\n  until the other council members are defeated. This deals 48,065 nature damage to all players every\n  6 seconds, and increases over time.\n</Mechanic>\n\n## Strategy\n\nThis council fight doesn't have any phases, just mechanics from one boss being countered by another. Positioning recommendations are unclear as baiting the pillars is wonky.\n\n- The bosses need to be killed evenly. A defeated boss becomes invulnerable and they channel raid damage u\n- There are three important mechanical interactions:\n  - Ranged need to default to staying spread to avoid duplicating [Conductive Mark](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371624?dd=15), and then clear these debuffs by rubbing [Earthen Pillars](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=370991?dd=15).\n  - When Kadros is channeling [Primal Blizzard](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371836?dd=15), dip into the [Scorched Ground](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=371514?dd=15) flame patches created by [Meteor Axes](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374038?dd=15) to not end up a popsicle.\n  - The two players who get [Meteor Axes](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374038?dd=15) need to stand ontop of [Earthen Pillars](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=370991?dd=15) to destroy them while 3-4 other players help soak each meteor. The meteors have to be soaked separately due to the vulnerability.\n- Interrupt Kadros' [Frost Spike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372315?dd=15) and Dathea's [Lightning Bolt](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372394) so players don't die to overlapping mechanics and keep these casters in melee for cleave.\n- Avoid Embar's [Slashing Blaze](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372027?dd=15) frontal cleave, and the emergence of [Earthen Pillars](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=370991?dd=15).\n\n## Video\n\n<figure>\n  <Video src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toWSHINDlCc\" />\n  <figcaption>\n    While we normally like Stankie's guides, his video for this boss is a lot of him waxing\n    hypothetical and I do not recommend it.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n",
