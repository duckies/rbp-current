    "raw": "\nTerros is a patchwerk boss (who notably lacks legs) with a focus on dropping pillars for tanks to break with a beam mechanic, a meteor soak mechanic, and a few minor mechanics requiring us to slowly rotate around his platform.\n\n## Mechanics\n\nRefer to [Mythic Trap ‚Äî Terros](https://www.mythictrap.com/en/vault/terros/heroic) for detailed visuals and animations of the mechanics. They have been listed here for reference.\n\n<Mechanic id={380487} name=\"Rock Blast\" caption=\"Split-meteor mechanic\">\n\nA random player is targeted with a swirling vortex meteor mechanic. It deals 961k nature damage\nsplit evenly among players within 12 yards and leaves an [Aftershock](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=386400) which erupts at the impact location a few seconds later.\n\n<Alert type=\"warning\">\n  This goes out at the same time as [Awakened Earth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381486).\n</Alert>\n<Alert>This mechanic can be solo'd with immunities. üê¢</Alert>\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={381486} name=\"Awakened Earth\" caption=\"Pillars\">\n  Several players are debuffed with [Awakened Earth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381486), marking them with a yellow arrow and surrounding them with a small circle. Upon expiration these spawn pillars of the same name that pulsate raid damage until destroyed. These should be placed in line with the primary tank position, or very close together but not stacked (splashing your debuff-mates), and *not in melee*.\n\n  <Alert type=\"warning\">\n  This goes out at the same time as [Rock Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=380487). These players should focus on placing their pillar in the correct spot and not soaking.\n</Alert>\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={381576} name=\"Seismic Assault\" caption=\"Pillar-dying DoT\">\n  Killing a pillar causes [Seismic Assault](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381576), dealing 24k\n  damage to the entire raid and applying a DoT for 12 seconds, stacking.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={377166} name=\"Resonating Annihilation\" caption=\"Pizza-slice Frontal\">\n  When Terros reaches 100 energy he casts a pizza-slice frontal which permanently covers a quarter\n  of the platform in miasma. It deals lethal (478k nature) damage to those caught in it, destroying\n  [Awakened Earth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381486) pillars in the process, and causes\n  [Fractured Rubble](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=378861) to fall from the ceiling which deals\n  impact damage and leaving behind miasma.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={383073} name=\"Shattering Impact\" caption=\"Swirly on Largest Player Clump\">\n  Terros periodically casts [Shattering Impact](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383073) as a large yellow circle which, if caught within, deals 252k nature damage and knocks players into the air. This mechanic also triggers [Fractured Rubble](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=378861) to fall from the ceiling.\n\nTesting suggests the mechanic targets the largest clump of players, which is typically melee due to the ranged players dealing with pillar mechanics.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={376279} name=\"Concussive Slam\" caption=\"Tank Laser Beam\">\n  Terros will emit a line of energy at the active tank that deals 242k physical damage and increases damage taken by 30% for 45 seconds, stacking. [Concussive Slam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=376279) will destroy any [Awakened Earth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381486) pillars in the path of the beam.\n\nIn the same spirit as Halondrus, the beam is used to break pillars.\n\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={377505} name=\"Frenzied Devastation\" caption=\"Soft Enrage\">\n  If the entire platform is filled with [Resonant Aftermath](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=382458)\n  puddles then Terros enrages, casting [Frenzied Devastation](https://www.wowhad.com/spell=377505)\n  repeatedly until our faces are melted off.\n</Mechanic>\n\n<Mechanic id={388393} name=\"Tectonic Barrage\" caption=\"Lonely Boss Screeching\">\n  If no player is within the bosses range he will cast [Tectonic\n  Barrage](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=388393) repeatedly.\n</Mechanic>\n\n## Heroic Strategy\n\n<Alert type=\"warning\">\n\nThis normal and heroic strategy is outdated. Everyone stacks in melee and all pillars go right-ish so they're all broken at the same time from now on.\n\n</Alert>\n\nPositioning matters but isn't the key to this fight. The boss periodically drops rocks that spawn miasma on the platform which would complicate rigid position assignments. Ensuring pillars are in a cohesive line for tanks to break is the only real requirement.\n\n<figure>\n  <ProseImage src=\"/images/strategies/vault/terros-rp-1.jpg\" width=\"1394\" height=\"500\" alt=\"\" />\n  <figcaption>The room is circular, but the RaidPlan is cropped for space.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe fight is based around a triangular formation for the ranged players. Ranged players will stack at <Marker type=\"diamond\" />. Melee and the off-tank should always be to the left of the current tank to avoid the [Concussive Slam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=376279) beam.\n\n1. Players debuffed with [Rock Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=380487) move to <Marker type=\"star\" />. The ranged and melee groups will dip into the outer edge of the circle to help soak.\n2. Players debuffed with [Awakened Earth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381486) move to <Marker type=\"skull\" /> and spread their circles in a line so the tank's beam mechanic can hit them all in one go.\n\nAt 100 energy when the boss casts [Resonating Annihilation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377166) the group will gateway out of the pizza slice. There are various similar abilities such as [Fractured Rubble](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=378861) which can also disrupt the group's positioning. Regardless, after movement the groups should best recreate the general positions they were in before, absent the markers. Think of the movement like Skolex, and the pillars and tank beam like Halondrus.\n\n## Video\n\n<figure>\n  <Video src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3koEFj75lkQ\" />\n  <figcaption>\n    The video does not show the players placing or breaking pillars in a consistent pattern. The\n    specifics of movement and positioning are not important, just get a feel for what the mechanics\n    look like.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n",
