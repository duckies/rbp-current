## Mechanics

Refer to [MythicTrap â€” Dathea](https://www.method.gg/guides/vault-of-the-incarnates/dathea-ascended-heroic) for detailed visuals and animations of the mechanics. They have been listed here in brief for reference.

<Mechanic id={375580} name="Zephyr Slam" caption="Tank Swap">
  
A tank swap mechanic which deals 240,325 physical damage and knocks the tank back. Subsequent applications apply a stacking 50% vulnerability to the damage and strength of the knockback.

If Dathea's current target isn't within reach she will cast [Aerial Buffet](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=376851), dealing 96,130 nature damage to her current target. Tanks that can get back to her quickly, or prevent knockbacks, can prevent this damage.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id={388302} name="Raging Burst" caption="Swirls">
  Dathea creates swirls on the ground that inflicts 48,089 damage upon impact. These swirls will
  spawn a [Raging Tempest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375424) at their location.
</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id={375424} name="Raging Tempest" caption="Tornados">

A tornado moves around the platform dealing 96,130 nature damage and throwing players into
the air when hit. They have a couple of effects aside from causing contact dermatitis:

1. They periodically pulse raid damage through [Raging Winds](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=384637).
2. When Dathea casts [Crosswinds](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=388410) the tornadoes will show an arrow and a swirly indicating a direction and location where they intend to move. Shortly thereafter the tornado rapidly moves to this new location, dealing 72,097 nature damage to any players at the destination and throwing them up in the air.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id={391686} name="Conductive Mark" caption="Covid Debuff">

Dathea targets a player and applies a DoT that deals 48,082 nature damage instantly and 7,210 nature damage every second for 15 seconds. The debuff also causes the player to take 10% increased nature damage. The debuff is refreshed and duplicated when it comes into contact with another player.

This is Dathea's mechanic from _The Primal Council_, only without the pillar to clear it. Since this debuff overlaps with nearly every other mechanic it's incredibly dangerous to the player, and the rest of the raid if they spread it to others.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id={376943} name="Cyclone" caption="Sucky Vortex">

Dathea creates a vortex that pulls players towards her dealing 28,839 nature damage every second for 10 seconds. Players who are pulled into the vortex practice the rapture. This is reasonably countered by raid-movement abilities like [Stampeding Roar](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=77764/stampeding-roar).

</Mechanic>

### Volatile Infuser

<Mechanic id={385812} name="Aerial Slash" caption="Tanked Add Ability">

Slashes their current target with 156,211 nature damage. The add needs to be tanked.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id={387627} name="Blowback" caption="Large Knockback on Death">

When the Volatile Infuser dies it explodes dealing 60,090 nature damage to all players and doing a considerable knockback. This knockback is used to move across platforms.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id={387943} name="Diverted Essence" caption="Interruptable Cast">

The Infuser gives love to mommy, increasing her damage by 20% for 20 seconds which stacks. The infuser on the main platform will be killed so that [Blowback](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=387627) can take players to the side platform to interrupt the other infuser.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id={388562} name="Unstable Gusts" caption="Swirls">

The Infuser will periodically expel swirls which deal 96,130 nature damage to players caught in the impact.

</Mechanic>

### Thunder Caller

<Mechanic id={384273} name="Storm Bolt" caption="Persistent Cast">

Thunder Callers are born with an insatiable lust to cast [Storm Bolt](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=384273) which deals 19,226 nature damage. The spell is interruptable and most forms of CC work on the Thunder Callers. They'll be grouped up and killed regardless.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id={390449} name="Thunderbolt" caption="Platform Vulnerability">

When Thunder Callers spawn they leave a thunderstorm on their respective side platform which makes players take 7,210 nature damage every 2 seconds for 1.5 minutes and increases the damage taken from this ability by 50% per tick.

</Mechanic>

## Mythic Changes

The only change on mythic is the infusers start the fight dormant in a ring around the platform and can be fed the now otherwise permanent [Conductive Marks](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391686/conductive-mark), granting them 10% energy and awakening them at 100%.

- Transferring a debuff to an infuser causes rolling damage, [Static Discharge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391717/static-discharge), similar to bursting in Mythic+. This should not go above 2 stacks outside of bloodlust.
- Activating an Infuser causes it to wipe the energy from the other dormant infusers.
- [Conductive Mark](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391686/conductive-mark) can still be spread, on top of now being permanent unless given to an infuser.

This fight is mechanically demanding in that, at any point, you could be given [Conductive Mark](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391686/conductive-mark) and will need to know where and when to deposit it. The ranged will also need to be near the next infuser we're activating yet aware of [Crosswinds](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=388410/crosswinds) timers to avoid baiting tornados on top of the infuser itself, which makes the marked players lives harder.

The recommended strategy is to force the first infuser to activate on the 2nd set of marks, but since only 4 marks go out in each set one person will be designated to create 2 duplicate marks for 6 total on the first round on pull. The fight then breaks into a rhythm of dumping 2 sets of debuffs into the infuser we're working on activating and then throwing away the first 2 debuffs every 3rd set.

<Alert type="info">

It's not strictly important which infuser(s) on sets 5, 8, and 11 are given the first two marks so long as it's not the infuser we're working to activate. However, this recommendation is based around the movement of ranged players, covered later.

</Alert>

Once we've activated 4 platform adds we do not want to activate the 5th as it's a nuisance, so only 9 marks can be given to the <Marker type="triangle" /> infuser. Any marks over this just have to live, laugh, and love somewhere on the platform.

### Raid Movement

      quality="90"
    />

    We start the fight with ranged near <Marker type="square" />. A designated ranged player will tell one of the marked players to wait to deposit their mark and duplicate 2 marks with them for 6 total deposited.

  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Marks 2">

    <ProseImage
      src="/images/strategies/vault/raidplans/dathea-rp-3.jpg"

      quality="90"
    />

    The second round of marks is deposited into <Marker type="square" />, delaying the deposit to make sure we don't go over 2 stacks of [Static Discharge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391717/static-discharge). This will activate the first Infuser, which is then brought to the middle of the room to be cleaved down. We want the marks to be done before the first cast of [Cyclone](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=376943/cyclone).

  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Marks 3">
  
    <ProseImage
      src="/images/strategies/vault/raidplans/dathea-rp-5.jpg"
      height="784"
      width="1394"
      alt=""
      quality="90"
    />

    We start charging the next infuser to 40%. There's no duplication or anything, just try to be standing between the old and new infuser locations to avoid placing bad tornados.

    <ProseImage
      src="/images/strategies/vault/raidplans/dathea-rp-6.jpg"
      height="784"
      width="1394"
      alt=""
      quality="90"
    />

    At `~1:23` we want the add to cast the blowback to the platform. The preceding marks go out at `0:58`, so we need to do them quickly and get into position for the infuser knockback.

    <Alert type="warning">

    Note the hunter heading for the abyss in the picture. We may have the infuser closer to the center of the main platform than players are used to from heroic. The knockback originates from the dying infuser with no change in intensity with how close or far you are from it. Players remaining on the platform will want to move closer to the infuser than was required on heroic. It's also important the platform players are in a proper line between the two infusers to avoid flying in some stupid direction.

    </Alert>

  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Marks 4">

    <ProseImage
      src="/images/strategies/vault/raidplans/dathea-rp-7.jpg"
      height="784"
      width="1394"
      alt=""
      quality="90"
    />

    The next set of marks goes into <Marker type="diamond" />. Nothing special again, only the players on the other platform aren't targets for marks so you're much more likely to get a marker if you remain on the main platform, especially melee.

  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Marks 5">

    <ProseImage
      src="/images/strategies/vault/raidplans/dathea-rp-8.jpg"

      quality="90"
    />

    The 5th set of marks occurs at the confluence of activating the <Marker type="diamond" /> infuser and the platform group returning. The Liquid WeakAura pack will warn you when it's safe to kill the platform infuser, or these players may get marks on the way back which is a wipe.

    We need to turn in 2 marks to <Marker type="star" /> *first*, then the remaining 2 to <Marker type="diamond" />. This will activate the <Marker type="diamond" /> infuser as the platform group is landing. The flow of the fight repeats from the "Marks 3" tab above till this one with 40-40-20 energy, with 20 energy being wasted on the next infuser first.
