## Mechanics

I haven't bothered teehee.

## Mythic Changes

- [Wildfire](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375871/wildfire) is even wilder, spewing wittle baby swirlies that apply another stack of the DoT if hit.
- Diurna now remembers the trajectories her staff took as it follows players and periodically spawns [Storm Fissure](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396779/storm-fissure) miasma in them, which deals `128,489` nature damage every half-second.
- Eggs that hatch through [Rapid Incubation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=376073/rapid-incubation) now spawn a dragon from the waves instead of a generic dragon, which will wipe us.
- [Diurna's Gaze](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=390561/diurnas-gaze) is a new mechanic where she stares ominously at players in her range, causing them to take increasing damage throughout phase 1.
- In phase 2, Diurna gets even madder at the situation and casts [Stoneslam Detonation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=396265/stoneslam-detonation) on the current tank. This is a generic meteor mechanic that can be countered by applying externals to the tank and having them solo it.

## Mythic Strategy

Much of the fight on Mythic is just _harder_ in comparison to Heroic. There is no way around breaking all 32 of her eggs, nor can we fight her near the waves of reinforcements, but we can choose how fast to break the eggs. There are two trains of thought in how to approach this:

1. Break all of the eggs in 11 staff activations (10 sets of 3 + 1 set of 2 = 32).
2. Break all of the eggs in 12 staff activations (8 sets of 3 + 4 sets of 2 = 32).

The "12-staff" approach is the original strategy, with a core facet being it gives more boss damage before entering phase 2. As gear checks have lessened the "11-staff" approach has become a popular viable alternative. This newer approach does more sets of 3 eggs to push the boss into phase 2 approximately 30 seconds faster, thereby eliminating the last set of reinforcements â€” two dragons that cast [Chilling Tantrum](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=375458/chilling-tantrum).

The recommended strategy from various sources is 11-staff approach, however, this strategy requires better play from the players on Diurna because of [Diurna's Gaze](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=390561/diurnas-gaze) being more dangerous with the extra sets of 3 eggs. It's similarly possible our damage is too low, and catapulting ourselves into phase 2 faster would only hurt us.

The reinforcements are in a fixed pattern and spawn 15 seconds apart per wave. If we employ the 11-staff strategy we will skip `5.2`.

### The Greatstaff Caveat

The staff placing swirlies on the ground is an annoyance that is best avoided in the latter parts of phase 1 as it is very difficult to navigate around if it's in the center of the room. We can stop the staff from doing this because it has a limit to the number of swirlies it can put in the room. It should run out after ~25 beams, and if we use the 11-staff strategy 9x3 = 27 beams on the perimeter of the room, satisfying this condition. If we use the 12-staff strategy we will have 2 extra players use the staff on the 5th set of eggs and run them into the wall.

<Alert type="warning">

The key to this is the number of _pools_ the staff would make, not the number of staff activations. The staff won't overlap pools if you bubble and stand there with the beam, or make really small movements. Egg runners should:

1. Always activate the staff as soon as it's available.
2. Run the staff beam in a straight line to, and through, the egg (or wall direction if doing a bogus staff activation).
