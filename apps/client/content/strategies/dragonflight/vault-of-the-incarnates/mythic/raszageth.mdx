## Phase 1 — The Winds of Change

### Mythic Changes

- [Static Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381615/static-charge) no longer leaves behind slow puddles.
- The [Hurricane Wing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377612/hurricane-wing) pushback now lasts longer and increases in duration with each successive cast. Each class has a combination of movement abilities and gateways to counteract it except for priests and paladins, who are saved by Evokers.
- [Volatile Current](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=388643/volatile-current) now creates sparks with 3 stacks, requiring their cast to be stopped 3 times.

### Strategy

The goal of the first phase is to push Raszageth during her 5th cast of [Hurricane Wing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377612/hurricane-wing), canceling the cast. The remainder of the phase is developing muscle memory for, and surviving different timings of, [Static Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381615/static-charge), the [Hurricane Wing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377612/hurricane-wing) pushback, and [Volatile Current](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=388643/volatile-current) sparks.

We will start the fight with the tanks maneuvering the boss to the southern edge of the platform. The arcing movement is only to prevent tanks from being within her large hitbox which would stop her before she reaches the edge; melee are free to chase after her as she waddles. The rest of phase 1 is focused on the 3 aforementioned mechanics:

1.  [Static Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381615/static-charge) is the same as on Heroic, sans miasma, except for the raid positioning being inverted. While facing the boss a WeakAura will tell you to go `Left`, `Back`, or `Right`. In the picture below, getting `Left` means you would to go the rightmost position in the picture (left of Raszageth).

    <ProseImage

      height="784"
      width="1394"
      alt="Raszageth RaidPlan #2"
    />

    There will be situations where some people may be unable to get to the ideal position in time because of the timing of surrounding mechanics, movement utility being reserved for pushbacks, or general slowness, e.g. Priests. The green in the picture indicates a region of acceptability for placing the mechanic in if you cannot reach it in time.

2.  To better organize ourselves for popping sparks, before Raszageth finishes each cast of [Volatile Current](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=388643/volatile-current) we will assemble in a delicious raspberry shape. Keeping ourselves fairly stacked will maximize the use of area denial abilities like [Ring of Peace](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=116844/ring-of-peace) and [Ring of Frost](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=113724/ring-of-frost) as they eat through all 3 layers of any sparks within them.

    <div className="float-left mr-6 mt-6">

      width="372"
      alt="Raszageth RaidPlan #3"
    />

    </div>

    Specifically, each player will be assigned a numbered position in the picture. Eight of the positions will have 2 players standing on top of each other, and the remaining 4 positions will be solo, squishy players. The outward positions will also be for slower players who are likely late to return from the pushback. When things get messy Shamans and Mages can spam this macro to clean up any remaining sparks.

    <div className="clear-left" />

    /tar boss1
    ```

3.  The pushback from [Hurricane Wing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377612/hurricane-wing) absent the slow miasma will require everyone to memorize a personalized strategy for their class. An example is given below found through resources passed along by the community, but some of it is considered overkill because of the nerfs to the pushback. Remember, the pushbacks increase in duration with each cast, but were nerfed in severity, so the first one may not require much from you.

    <ProseImage
      className="mx-auto my-0 mt-6 rounded-lg md:float-right md:ml-4"

      width="500"
      height="302"
      alt="Beam direction arrow"
    />

    Importantly, after each pushback, the boss will cast [Lightning Breath](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377594/lightning-breath). If we're all stacked behind the boss and are pushed in a line away from her the direction she faces _should_ be consistent, however, it's not guaranteed. Regardless, give her a glance and plenty of clearance as dying to the beam is a stupid way to end a pull.

    The targeting halo surrounding Raszageth's model has an arrow at her model's front that will always show the direction of her beam if you don't want to crane your camera up to her face.

    <div className="clear-right" />

    <Alert type="info">

    Plan on having [Time Spiral](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374968/time-spiral) on the 3rd and 4th pushback, allowing you to reuse your "major" movement utility a second time for the duration. For example, Warlocks need it to teleport twice in a row, and Monks (who aren't Windwalkers) benefit greatly from a 3rd cast of Torpedo.

    It's recommended to use the gateway on the 2nd pushback whenever possible as there are sparks immediately after the pushback ends, though not overly important thanks to the purge macro. Whatever works best for you and maximizes your uptime and availability for the mechanics is what you should do.

| 3:01 | [Hurricane Wing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377612/hurricane-wing)     |   5   | She begins her cast at `2:55` and it's a fixed, 6-second cast.           |

Some notes about these:

1. She pushes and becomes immune at 65%. We have 6 seconds to push her after `2:55` or she'll finish the 5th winds cast. Pushing her faster does not benefit us as cooldown timings are best milked for later phases.
2. The danger points are the sparks at `1:24` because healers just came back from winds, and `2:08-10` as the charge explosions go off shortly before sparks. The charge runners _need_ to use a personal, and purge-macro-ers should be ready to look for any outlandish sparks.
3. [Lightning Breath](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377594/lightning-breath) is not listed, but WeakAuras can scream at you plenty well enough. They occur after every winds, but there's also a cast between each winds, so the group will need to swivel around her butt.

## Intermission 1 — The Primalist Strike

The first intermission on Mythic differentiates the two platforms as frost and fire platforms with a new themed add in each pack. You can tell which platform is which by the color of the orbs floating around them.

- The left, frost-themed platform now has a Frostforged Zealot that casts [Shattering Shroud](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=397382/shattering-shroud). This deals `64,224` frost damage and applies a considerable, `383,385` healing absorb shield to everyone on that platform for 10 seconds, exploding for `642,443` nature damage to everyone on the platform if not healed off.
- The right, fire-themed platform now has a Flamesworn Herald that spawns with [Flame Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=397387/flame-shield), a `1,641,355` damage shield (45% of its health) that gives it immunity to interrupts. The Herald will try to cast [Blazing Roar](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=397468/blazing-roar), a 6-second cast that deals `642,443` fire damage to everyone on the platform.

The frost platform is the more dangerous of the two as [Shattering Shroud](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=397382/shattering-shroud) will be active on players on top of the natural damage from the other adds, making proper interrupts essential. Furthermore, the short time between each add pack is difficult on the healers' cooldown timings, so the primary strategy is to annihilate the 2nd pack's Frostforged Zealot before it can cast [Shattering Shroud](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=397382/shattering-shroud), requiring ~`4,390,000` damage in about 8 seconds.

We will assign things like Grieftorch and Egg-staff for the shields and 2nd Zealot, so always communicate with us before changing anything with these items. There are further nuances to each side with baiting Raszageth's breath and kill orders, so the rest of the guide will be split for each side.

### Engineering Fun

If you're an Engineer, and you're not a class that negates fall damage by gliding, you can enchant your boots with [Momentum Redistributor Boots](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=330914/momentum-redistributor-boots). It'll significantly reduce the amount of damage you take from being knocked to the intermission platform and deals that damage to the Ruiner, making it faster to break the shield.

### Frost Platform

The frost platform priority is below. If we're on the second add set then the zealot needs to be nuked down before its cast gets off. Otherwise, the priority follows the most damaging monsters: the Ruiner and then the small adds. Kicks must be maintained even when we're dodging breaths as a breath can overlap with the healing shields.

```
Add Priority: Second Set Zealot >>> Ruiner > Small Adds > Zealot
```

#### First Breath

The shrouds will go out while dodging the breath if the frost platform is first. Add interrupts are important as players cannot be healed at this time.

### Fire Platform

The fire platform is straightforward. Heralds are priority targets and interrupts on it and the small adds are the next most important mechanic as you only have one healer. Just be weary of low-health adds due to them being buffed below 50% health.

```
Add Priority: Herald >>> Ruiner > Small Adds
```

#### First Breath

The herald's shield will activate while dodging the first breath, so be nuking it down while moving.

### Movement Guidelines

The movement between packs is something the tanks are going to memorize, but there are some things to keep in mind:

1. If a platform group gets the first breath they're baiting the 2nd breath before the 2nd add pack, otherwise they're baiting the 3rd breath before the 3rd add pack.
2. If a breath doesn't happen during an add set the group baits one after the adds die before moving on.
3. The breath targets the largest number of people in a breath line, not the largest clump.
4. There is no set timing when you engage each pack, but it's generally `3:10`, `3:40`, and `4:10`.

The only person allowed to deviate is Froggy if he needs to maintain breath. 🌬️ Furthermore, under no circumstance do we want to break a Ruiner's shield before the main group is there.

## Phase 2 — Surging Power

There are four main mechanics in phase two I'll summarize then discuss in depth. Things such as the tank swap, lightning swirlies, and the DoT she applies to random players seen in phase one are present yet unchanged. However, she will not cast [Lightning Breath](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377597/lightning-breath) in this phase.

1. [Stormsurge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=387261/stormsurge) — The core facets of the shield mechanic are the same as heroic. Everyone is pre-spread, players converge into groups of red and blue debuffs to get the 200% damage and healing buff ([Focused Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=394582/focused-charge)), and then burst down her shield. On Mythic, however, non-healers are randomly given a debuff called [Inversion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=394584/inversion) that will change their color after 3 seconds, forcing them to swap groups.
2. [Tempest Wing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=385574/tempest-wing) — The _spicy_ pushback has been nerfed considerably and is handled by spreading, using a defensive, and moving through the wave as fast as possible. New to Mythic, while you're in the wave you radiate `38,547` nature damage every 0.5 seconds to players within 6 yards of you ([Tempest Wing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=388876/tempest-wing)).
3. [Fulminating Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377467/fulminating-charge) — Three players are targeted by large circles that explode after 3 seconds that which deals `80,305` nature damage to anyone in the explosion, attempts to jump to the nearest person within the blast, and leaves a nasty debuff called [Lingering Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=390911/lingering-charge) to the player which deals `59,105` nature damage every 1.5 seconds for 9 seconds. Post-nerf this mechanic applies a 75% snare to the targets.
4. [Volatile Current](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=388643/volatile-current) — This mechanic is the same as the one in phase one; each person deals `128,489` nature damage around them and spawns a spark with 3 debuffs we need to pop.

### Mechanical Breakdown

These tabs go over these four primary mechanics in the sequence we first see them. The biggest takeaways I have are that most progression failures are likely people not using personals for heavy-hitting abilities, or being out of range of, or not being given enough care from, healers. The other mechanics are pass-fail.

<Tabs>

  <Tab label="1 — Stormsurge">

    <div className="flex justify-center flex-wrap">
      <ProseImage src="/images/strategies/vault/raidplans/raszageth-rp-p2-3.png" width="878" height="324" alt="Raszageth Phase 2 RaidPlan#1" quality="100" />
    </div>

    The first mechanic is [Stormsurge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=387261/stormsurge) after a little bit of downtime as she transitions from the intermission. Each player will be assigned a position in the above picture so everyone is pre-spread. Once the mechanic activates, giving everyone their red or blue debuffs, blue players will remain still for a second or two to allow red players to collapse under the boss, then blue players will find each other and stand somewhere on the outer ring in one or more groups.

    The stormshields aren't a huge deal to break or to heal. With things like Resto Druid, Discipline, and Monk ramping covering them easily. However, if you are going to be using a personal during it do so at the end as the damage increases the longer the shield is up. It's more than likely some DPS cooldowns will be weaned off the shields as well. The major component of the shields is not messing up the colors.

    <Alert type="info">
      One issue blue players may run into is if they're in a group of only 2 players, and at least one of these players isn't a healer. If one of them gets inverted the other player will be left alone. This half-circle shape for ranged positions helps make it easier for players in this situation to rejoin the blue community without having to circumnavigate the entire boss. However, check how close we are to breaking the shield as you may waste all of that remaining time moving. Red players who get inverted should try to look out for smaller blue groups to bolster their numbers, which can prevent these scenarios.

      I mention the possible futility of moving because if you're in a small group such as this, yelling at your partner to move halfway into the shield will add unnecessary friction to a mechanic that, when it comes to the shield itself, is the easiest part of phase two.

    #### Mechanical Deep-Dive

    [Inversion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=394584/inversion) is a 3-second debuff that locks your 200% damage and healing buff for the duration, but upon expiration switches you to the opposite color group. For these 3 seconds you are not able to trigger the explosion because of the "locking" component, so you can barrel through anyone in your way to get to your new group.

    Touching the wrong color (without Inversion) triggers a 5-yard explosion that deals lethal damage called [Scattered Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=394583/scattered-charge). The tooltip is broken, but it does `481,833` nature damage within the explosion, and `38,954` nature damage per second if you managed to survive the initial blast. There is a WeakAura in the Liquid pack called `Inversion (warning)` that plays an airhorn and gives a large countdown for how much grace period you have left. It's enabled by default, and if you turn it off you're a bad person.

    </div>

    The second mechanic is [Tempest Wing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=385574/tempest-wing). To begin, the [Stormsurge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=387261/stormsurge) positions are shown again because they're a good foundation for staying spread for this mechanic. It's not recommended to use the gateway as a group because it's easy to do a ton of damage to each other with the new spreading component on Mythic. It's incredibly easy to get through the ring unaided, so I would only plan to use gateways if you're a notably slow class.

    If you do use a gateway, you just barely have enough time for the mandatory gateway in P3, so you're allowed to use the gateway on the 4th winds if you really want to.

  </Tab>

  <Tab label="3 — Fulminating Charge">

    Immediately following the winds are [Fulminating Charges](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377467/fulminating-charge). It's not worth pulling up a visual for, but it's the very large rings around 3 players that try to jump to others. As this mechanic has a penchant for targeting ranged players, they are expected to be pre-spread to the outer parts of the room. However, the responsibility for getting the hell out of the way is on everyone else.

    If a melee gets the mechanic there is still an expectation that they are given [Tiger's Lust](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=116841/tigers-lust) or similar and they book it to the edge of the room. In the event this doesn't happen, the current off-tank can be pivoting around the boss looking for melee with these debuffs to stand on top of to take the debuff from them. Anyone else in the circle will still take an 80k hit, but only the closest person (the tank) will get the debuff and [Lingering Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=390911/lingering-charge). Having multiple stacks of this debuff, or extraneous DPS with the debuff, will strain the healers immensely, but tanks will shrug it off.

    Recent nerfs have converted the root to a 75% snare, so things like [Tiger's Lust](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=116841/tigers-lust) have been downgraded from required to super-helpful as most classes can "deal" in some form or fashion.

    <Alert type="info">

      There is a WeakAura in liquid pack called `Fulminating Charge priority glow (blue)` that is useful for classes with things like [Tiger's Lust](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=116841/tigers-lust). It is setup via the custom options, asking you to pick player 1, 2, or 3. It is coded so that player 1 is the least likely to deal with the root* themselves, followed by 2 who is slightly better off, and 3 who can probably deal with it themselves.

      The asterisk* is of course because the mechanic doesn't root anymore but the pack hasn't been updated. However, odds are the gradient of classes that can't deal with a root is similar to the gradient of classes that can't deal with a snare. Regardless, it doesn't hurt to have Monks enable this and make sure they have different player numbers selected.

    </div>

    The fourth mechanic, and the last of the mechanics to discuss, is [Volatile Current](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=388643/volatile-current). Absolutely nothing about this mechanic is different in phase two. The positions are going to be the same relative to the boss but with the room flipped so that Raszageth is facing cardinal north in the room instead of south. The pictures are there to illustrate where your position is with a northward-facing orientation, but again, absolutely nothing about the spots relative to each other or the boss is different.

## WeakAuras

### Required WeakAuras

- [Liquid Vault of the Incarnates](https://wago.io/LiquidVault) — Most raiders should have this as we provided it before. You may disable any WeakAura **except** the ones listed below at your own discretion:
  1. `Static Charge assignments arrows`: Tells you where to go with Static Charge in the first phase.
  2. `Inversion (warning)`: This airhorns when you need to switch polarity groups and gives you a countdown till your vulnerability wears off.

Don't delete any of the WeakAuras as we may tell you to turn on specific ones as progress is made.

### Optional WeakAuras

- [Bird Reminders](https://wago.io/BirdReminders) — Lets you assign personal notes for pushbacks or sparks so you remember what utility you're meant to use there.
- [Shattering Shroud - Help yourself](https://wago.io/aqKBiUZGV) — Warns you if you have Shattering Shroud and plays an airhorn if there are 3 seconds remaining with it so you can use a healthstone or health pot.
- [Let Fly](https://wago.io/VjxVZ2KfZ) — Plays a very important sound when we're knocked to a platform.
