## Phase 1 — The Winds of Change

### Mythic Changes

- [Static Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381615/static-charge) no longer leaves behind slow puddles.
- The [Hurricane Wing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377612/hurricane-wing) pushback now lasts longer and increases in duration with each successive cast. Each class has a combination of movement abilities and gateways to counteract it except for priests and paladins, who are saved by Evokers.
- [Volatile Current](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=388643/volatile-current) now creates sparks with 3 stacks, requiring their cast to be stopped 3 times.

### Strategy

The goal of the first phase is to push Raszageth during her 5th cast of [Hurricane Wing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377612/hurricane-wing), canceling the cast. The remainder of the phase is developing muscle memory for, and surviving different timings of, [Static Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381615/static-charge), the [Hurricane Wing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377612/hurricane-wing) pushback, and [Volatile Current](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=388643/volatile-current) sparks.

We will start the fight with the tanks maneuvering the boss to the southern edge of the platform. The arcing movement is only to prevent tanks from being within her large hitbox which would stop her before she reaches the edge; melee are free to chase after her as she waddles. The rest of phase 1 is focused on the 3 aforementioned mechanics:

1.  [Static Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381615/static-charge) is the same as on Heroic, sans miasma, except for the raid positioning being inverted. While facing the boss a WeakAura will tell you to go `Left`, `Back`, or `Right`. In the picture below, getting `Left` means you would to go the rightmost position in the picture (left of Raszageth).

    <ProseImage

      height="784"
      width="1394"
      alt="Raszageth RaidPlan #2"
    />

    There will be situations where some people may be unable to get to the ideal position in time because of the timing of surrounding mechanics, movement utility being reserved for pushbacks, or general slowness, e.g. Priests. The green in the picture indicates a region of acceptability for placing the mechanic in if you cannot reach it in time.

2.  To better organize ourselves for popping sparks, before Raszageth finishes each cast of [Volatile Current](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=388643/volatile-current) we will assemble in a delicious raspberry shape. Keeping ourselves fairly stacked will maximize the use of area denial abilities like [Ring of Peace](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=116844/ring-of-peace) and [Ring of Frost](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=113724/ring-of-frost) as they eat through all 3 layers of any sparks within them.

    <div className="float-left mr-6 mt-6">

      width="372"
      alt="Raszageth RaidPlan #3"
    />

    </div>

    Specifically, each player will be assigned a numbered position in the picture. Eight of the positions will have 2 players standing on top of each other, and the remaining 4 positions will be solo, squishy players. The outward positions will also be for slower players who are likely late to return from the pushback. When things get messy Shamans and Mages can spam this macro to clean up any remaining sparks.

    <div className="clear-left" />

    /targetenemy
    /focus
    /tar player
    /tar focus
    /tar boss1
    /targetlasttarget
    /cast [harm,nodead] Spellsteal
    /tar boss1
    ```

3.  The pushback from [Hurricane Wing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377612/hurricane-wing) absent the slow miasma will require everyone to memorize a personalized strategy for their class. An example is given below found through resources passed along by the community, but some of it is considered overkill because of the nerfs to the pushback. Remember, the pushbacks increase in duration with each cast, but were nerfed in severity, so the first one may not require much from you.

    Importantly, after each pushback, the boss will cast [Lightning Breath](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377594/lightning-breath). If we're all stacked behind the boss and are pushed in a line away from her the direction she faces _should_ be consistent, however it's not guaranteed. Regardless, give her a glance and plenty of clearance as dying to the beam is a stupid way to end a pull.

    <Alert type="info">

    Plan on having [Time Spiral](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374968/time-spiral) on the 3rd and 4th pushback, allowing you to reuse your "major" movement utility a second time for the duration. For example, Warlocks need it to teleport twice in a row, and Monks (who aren't Windwalkers) benefit greatly from a 3rd cast of Torpedo.

    It's recommended to use the gateway on the 2nd pushback whenever possible as there are sparks immediately after the pushback ends, though not overly important thanks to the purge macro. Whatever works best for you and maximizes your uptime and availability for the mechanics is what you should do.

| 3:01 | [Hurricane Wing](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377612/hurricane-wing)     |   5   | She begins her cast at `2:55` and it's a fixed, 6-second cast.           |

Some notes about these:

1. She pushes and becomes immune at 65%. We have 6 seconds to push her after `2:55` or she'll finish the 5th winds cast. Pushing her faster does not benefit us as cooldown timings are best milked for later phases.
2. The danger points are the sparks at `1:24` because healers just came back from winds, and `2:08-10` as the charge explosions go off shortly before sparks. The charge runners _need_ to use a personal, and purge-macro-ers should be ready to look for any outlandish sparks.
3. [Lightning Breath](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377594/lightning-breath) is not listed, but WeakAuras can scream at you plenty well enough. They occur after every winds, but there's also a cast between each winds, so the group will need to swivel around her butt. You will be yelled at for dying to this.

## Intermission 1 — The Primalist Strike

The first intermission on Mythic differentiates the two platforms as frost and fire platforms with a new themed add in each pack. You can tell which platform is which by the color of the orbs floating around them.

- The left, frost-themed platform now has a Frostforged Zealot that casts [Shattering Shroud](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=397382/shattering-shroud). This deals `64,224` frost damage and applies a considerable, `383,385` healing absorb shield to everyone on that platform for 10 seconds, exploding for `642,443` nature damage to everyone on the platform if not healed off.
- The right, fire-themed platform now has a Flamesworn Herald that spawns with [Flame Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=397387/flame-shield), a `1,641,355` damage shield (45% of its health) that gives it immunity to interrupts. The Herald will try to cast [Blazing Roar](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=397468/blazing-roar), a 6-second cast that deals `642,443` fire damage to everyone on the platform.

The frost platform is the more dangerous of the two as [Shattering Shroud](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=397382/shattering-shroud) will be active on players on top of the natural damage from the other adds, making proper interrupts essential. Furthermore, the short time between each add pack is difficult on the healers' cooldown timings, so the primary strategy is to annihilate the 2nd pack's Frostforged Zealot before it can cast [Shattering Shroud](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=397382/shattering-shroud), requiring ~`4,390,000` damage in about 8 seconds.

We will assign things like Grieftorch and Egg-staff for the shields and 2nd Zealot, so always communicate with us before changing anything with these items. There are further nuances to each side with baiting Raszageth's breath and kill orders, so the rest of the guide will be split for each side.

### Engineering Fun

If you're an Engineer, and you're not a class that negates fall damage by gliding, you can enchant your boots with [Momentum Redistributor Boots](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=330914/momentum-redistributor-boots). It'll significantly reduce the amount of damage you take from being knocked to the intermission platform and deals that damage to the Ruiner, making it faster to break the shield.

### Frost Platform

The frost platform priority is below. If we're on the second add set then the zealot needs to be nuked down before its cast gets off. Otherwise, the priority follows the most damaging monsters: the Ruiner and then the small adds. Kicks must be maintained even when we're dodging breaths as a breath can overlap with the healing shields.

```
Add Priority: Second Set Zealot >>> Ruiner > Small Adds > Zealot
```

#### First Breath

The shrouds will go out while dodging the breath if the frost platform is first. Add interrupts are important as players cannot be healed at this time.

### Fire Platform

The fire platform is straightforward. Heralds are priority targets and interrupts on it and the small adds are the next most important mechanic as you only have one healer. Just be weary of low-health adds due to them being buffed below 50% health.

```
Add Priority: Herald >>> Ruiner > Small Adds
```

#### First Breath

The herald's shield will activate while dodging the first breath, so be nuking it down while moving.

### Movement Guidelines

The movement between packs is something the tanks are going to memorize, but there are some things to keep in mind:

1. If a platform group gets the first breath they're baiting the 2nd breath before the 2nd add pack, otherwise they're baiting the 3rd breath before the 3rd add pack.
2. If a breath doesn't happen during an add set the group baits one after the adds die before moving on.
3. The breath targets the largest number of people in a breath line, not the largest clump.
4. There is no set timing when you engage each pack, but it's generally `3:10`, `3:40`, and `4:10`.

The only person allowed to deviate is Froggy if he needs to maintain breath. 🌬️ Furthermore, under no circumstance do we want to break a Ruiner's shield before the main group is there.
