## Mechanics

Refer to [MythicTrap — Kurog Grimtotem](https://www.mythictrap.com/en/vault/kurog) for detailed visuals and animations of the mechanics.

<Mechanic id={374861} name="Primal Shift" caption="Altar Activation Damage">
  Moving Kurog into a different quadrant of the room causes him to attune himself to the quadrant's
  altar. Doing so inflicts `36,049` damage to the raid and applies [Primal
  Break](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374864) making the raid 300% more vulnerable to this damage,
  stacking.
</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id={390548} name="Sundering Strike" caption="Tank Swap">
  Kurog attacks his current target inflicting `324,438` damage to players in a frontal cone and
  knocking them back. Players that are hit suffer `28,839` physical damage every second for 35
  seconds.
</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id={371971} name="Elemental Surge" caption="Enrage">
  If Kurog is in the middle of the room, aka not in one of the quadrants, he will deal `7,210`
  elemental damage to the raid every 0.5 seconds, stacking. This should never be triggered.
</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id={374779} name="Primal Barrier" caption="Intermission Shield">
  At 100 energy Kurog enters his no-touchy shell and makes us kill his children.
</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id={396243} name="Primal Attunement" caption="Soft Enrage">
  The third time Kurog reaches 100 energy he gains all altar abilities simultaneously and deals
  `7,210` elemental damage to the raid every 0.5 seconds, stacking. This is an enrage mechanic that
  is hopefully not seen.
</Mechanic>

### Elemental Altars

    ### Altar Mechanics

    <Mechanic id={374881} name="Flame Dominance" caption="Altar Raid Damage">
      Each altar has a "dominance" mechanic causing him to pulse `33,645` damage of the corresponding
      element type to the raid every 4 seconds.

      Triggering an altar, killing an intermission add associated with an altar, and Kurog casting his ultimate ability at 100 energy each add 10% increased damage to this mechanic.
    </Mechanic>

    <Mechanic id={382563} name="Magma Burst" caption="Debuff Circles">
      Kurog hurls magma at several players, dealing `60,081` fire damage to them and causing a large fire circle to spawn under them that deals `108,146` fire damage every second to players within it.

      Players should bait this mechanic away from the raid as the circle lasts a long time.
    </Mechanic>

    <Mechanic id={373329} name="Molten Rupture" caption="Fire Lines">

      Kurog radiates fire lines dealing `180,243` fire damage to players hit by them.

    </Mechanic>

    <Mechanic id={374022} name="Searing Carnage" caption="Trailing Fire Bombs">

      Several players are infused with fire, causing them to leave a fire swirly in their path every 1 second for 5 seconds. Each swirly explodes after 2 seconds dealing `447,962` fire damage to players hit.

      This is a typical bombardment-style mechanic where the player should keep moving to avoid the swirly and also avoid placing it under other players.

    </Mechanic>

    ### Intermission — Blazing Fiend

    <Mechanic id={375828} name="Blistering Presence" caption="Pulsating Damage">
      The raid burns for `2,403` fire damage every second while the Blazing Fiend lives, stacking.
    </Mechanic>

    <Mechanic id={374485} name="Magma Flow" caption="Dodge">
      Magma pools form at random locations that inflict `108,146` damage when stood in.
    </Mechanic>

    <Mechanic id={376063} name="Smoldering Hellion" caption="Interrupt & Kill">
      Adds will spawn from the magma pools, targeting random players with an interruptable cast that deals `76,094` fire damage.
    </Mechanic>

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab label="Altar of Frost">

    ### Altar Mechanics

    <Mechanic id={374916} name="Frost Dominance" caption="Altar Raid Damage">
      Each altar has a "dominance" mechanic causing him to pulse `33,645` damage of the corresponding
      element type to the raid every 4 seconds.

      Triggering an altar, killing an intermission add associated with an altar, and Kurog casting his ultimate ability at 100 energy each add 10% increased damage to this mechanic.
    </Mechanic>

    <Mechanic id={373678} name="Biting Chill" caption="Rot Damage">
      Kurog debuffs all players with [Biting Chill](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373678) causing them to take `12,016` frost damage every second for 10 seconds.
    </Mechanic>

    <Mechanic id={391019} name="Frigid Torrent" caption="Dodge Orbs">
      Kurog knocks players in melee back and summons orbs every 2 seconds for 4 seconds that travel in lines away from him. Players hit take `180,243` frost damage and are stunned for 6 seconds, though dispellable.
    </Mechanic>

    <Mechanic id={372456} name="Absolute Zero" caption="Soaking Meteor">
      A chunk of ice is hurled at two players, inflicting `740,974` frost damage split evenly among all players in the impact location.

      Getting hit gives a player 1 stack of [Frost Bite](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372514). Reaching 2 stacks causes the player to be [Frozen Solid](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372517), stunning the player and receiving a large DoT for 10 seconds. The vulnerability implies two separate soaking groups.
    </Mechanic>

    ### Intermission — Frozen Destroyer

    <Mechanic id={375825} name="Chilling Presence" caption="Pulsating Damage">
      The raid shivers for `2,403` frost damage every second while the Frozen Destroyer lives, stacking.
    </Mechanic>

    <Mechanic id={374623} name="Frozen Binds" caption="Interrupt">
      The Frozen Destroyer unleashes a frost nova that inflicts `72,097` frost damage to all players and an additional `16,823` frost damage every 2 seconds for 20 seconds and reducing movement speed by 10%, stacking.

      This is interruptable.
    </Mechanic>

    <Mechanic id={374624} name="Freezing Tempest" caption="Stack in Melee">
      Winds form around the Frozen Destroyer dealing `96,129` frost damage every second to players farther than 10 yards away. However, players within 10 yards take `24,279` frost damage every second.
    </Mechanic>

  <Tab label="Altar of Stone">
    
    ### Altar Mechanics

    <Mechanic id={374917} name="Earth Dominance" caption="Altar Raid Damage">
      Each altar has a "dominance" mechanic causing him to pulse `33,645` damage of the corresponding
      element type to the raid every 4 seconds.

      Triggering an altar, killing an intermission add associated with an altar, and Kurog casting his ultimate ability at 100 energy each add 10% increased damage to this mechanic.
    </Mechanic>

    <Mechanic id={395894} name="Erupting Bedrock" caption="Dodge Rings">
      A sequence of concentric earthen rings erupts from the ground, inflicting `288,390` nature damage to players struck. Originates from melee and travels outwards.
    </Mechanic>

    <Mechanic id={391055} name="Enveloping Earth" caption="Large Healing Absorb">
      Several players are debuffed with a healing absorb for `379,713`.
    </Mechanic>

    <Mechanic id={374705} name="Seismic Rupture" caption="Adds">
      Several `Earth Breaker` adds erupt from the ground, dealing `216,292` nature damage to players in the eruption. These adds must be tanked and should be stunned and focused down as they cause [Skeletal Fractures](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=377780), a stacking 6% physical vulnerability to the tank.
    </Mechanic>

    ### Intermission — Tectonic Crusher

    <Mechanic id={375824} name="Shattering Presence" caption="Pulsating Damage">
      The raid burns for `2,403` nature damage every second while the Tectonic Crusher lives, stacking.
    </Mechanic>

    <Mechanic id={374321} name="Breaking Gravel" caption="Tank Swap">
      Melee attacks debuff the target with a stacking 3% physical damage vulnerability that is removed after attacking a new target.
    </Mechanic>

    <Mechanic id={374427} name="Ground Shatter" caption="Spread & Aftershock">
      Several players are infused with volatile earth, erupting to deal `168,227` nature damage to nearby players after 5 seconds within 10 yards. This is a collective spread mechanic.

      After the effect expires, [Violent Upheavel](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374430) is triggered at the location dealing `216,292` nature damage within 10 yards and knocking players away.

    ### Altar Mechanics

    <Mechanic id={374918} name="Storm Dominance" caption="Altar Raid Damage">
      Each altar has a "dominance" mechanic causing him to pulse `33,645` damage of the corresponding
      element type to the raid every 4 seconds.

      Triggering an altar, killing an intermission add associated with an altar, and Kurog casting his ultimate ability at 100 energy each add 10% increased damage to this mechanic.
    </Mechanic>

    <Mechanic id={390920} name="Shocking Burst" caption="Spread">
      Kurog charges several players with electricity for 5 seconds. Upon expiration, charged players inflict `168,227` nature damage to players within 12 yards. This is a large circle that players need to spread out for.
    </Mechanic>

    <Mechanic id={373487} name="Lightning Crash" caption="Jumping DoT">
      Several players are affected with a debuff that, on expiration, increases nature damage taken by 30% and inflicts `12,016` nature damage every 1 second to the closest player for 8 seconds.

      The goal is to avoid two players with [Lightning Crash](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=373487) spreading their debuff to each other as this will increase their stacks and likely kill them both. Find a friend without the debuff and shock them.
    </Mechanic>

    <Mechanic id={374217} name="Thunder Strike" caption="Soaking Circles">
      Several swirlies spawn around the altar that inflicts `84,113` nature damage to players in their impact. If one of these fails to hit a player then the entire raid will take `218,461` nature damage.
    </Mechanic>

    ### Intermission — Thundering Ravager

    <Mechanic id={375792} name="Thundering Presence" caption="Pulsating Damage">
       The raid suffers `2,403` nature damage every second while the Thundering Ravager lives, stacking.
    </Mechanic>

    <Mechanic id={374621} name="Storm Break" caption="Nothing Personal Kid">
      The Thundering Ravager vanishes and teleports behind a random player to unleash [Lethal Current](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391696) `40,855` nature damage every second for 6 seconds around the player.

## Mythic Changes

Kurog will now summon an elemental in phase 1 corresponding to his active altar, turning this into a 2-target cleave fight.

- These new elementals share a frontal ability flavored by their element — [Flame Smite](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=393309), [Frost Smite](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=393297), [Earth Smite](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391268), and [Storm Smite](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=393429). Each hit deals `256,977` fire, frost, or nature damage with a unique secondary effect.
  - The flame one lobs fire on the ground nearby.
  - The frost one slows the tank (or anyone else hit).
  - The earth one applies a large healing absorb to the tank (or anyone else hit).
  - The lightning one causes the tank (or anyone else hit) to become electrified, dealing massive damage to any players within 12 yards of them for 5 seconds.
- They also have 1-2 other abilities:
  - **Flamewrought Eradicator** casts [Raging Inferno](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391555), converting any [Magma Pools](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374554) Kurog created into Raging Infernos. Infernos last for 15 seconds and can be soaked by players, dealing `54,608` fire damage every second and consuming part of the magma pool. If the inferno expires without being fully consumed a _Smoldering Hellion_ add is summoned, which casts things and is just generally annoying.
  - **Frostwrought Dominator** will mimic Kurog and cast [Frigid Torrent](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391019) when Kurog casts it for double the icy-ball dodging goodness. The Dominator also has a persistent aura, [Icy Tempest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391272), requiring players to be within 10 yards of at least 2 other players lest they become [Frozen Solid](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372517) for 10 seconds.
  - **Earthwrought Smasher** casts [Erupting Bedrock](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=395893), the rippling ground dodging mechanic, the same as Kurog's just now more often I suppose.
  - **Stormwrought Despoiler** casts [Orb Lightning](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374620), requiring players to chase down and soak orbs giving the player a light, 10 minute DoT or it explodes, dealing `289,100` nature damage to the raid. However, with our strategy we will not be summoning this add (intentionally, anyway).

The intermission adds now bring mechanics from phase 1 with them.

- **Blazing Fiend** now also casts [Searing Carnage](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374022), the flame dance mechanic.
- **Frozen Destroyer** now also casts [Absolute Zero](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=372456), the dual-meteor soaking mechanic.
- **Tectonic Crusher** now also casts [Seismic Rupture](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374705/seismic-rupture), spawning ground circles that erupt into the little adds.
- **Thundering Ravager** now also casts [Thunder Strike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374217/thunder-strike), the lightning swirls that must be soaked in phase 1. We have not seen this mechanic in heroic lately, but in mythic, these swirls will be in the central circle of the room, instead of randomly in a quadrant.

## Mythic Strategy

The elementals summoned from activating an altar have a lot of health and don't despawn when Kurog enters the intermission, which would lead to a wipe if one made it there. This means each phase 1 must consist of only a single altar. However, there is a major complication where Kurog picks the intermission elementals based on altar stacks:

- The 2 highest stack counts are the elements he chooses.
- _If one of the 2 highest stacks is tied with a third or fourth, those other elements can be chosen randomly._
- Elementals in the intermission can only be fought once, so the second intermission is set based on the first.

For example, if we sat in fire till the first intermission he would have 30 fire stacks and 1 stack of all other elements. The first highest is "30" fire, so he picks a fire elemental. Next he sees "1" tied with all other elements, so he picks another element at random. This has a 2 in 3 chance of causing an instant wipe. To combat this, we will get Kurog to 30 stacks then wiggle him to the storm altar at approximately 97 energy, giving us a stack of storm but not staying in the altar long enough to spawn the add. This sets the altar count to approximately 30 fire, 2 storm, 1 frost, 1 earth, guaranteeing we get the fire and lightning elemental in the intermission.

The downside to this strategy is there is a very tight window where it's appropriate to get Kurog into the storm altar quadrant. Do it too early and we get an add that wipes us, too late and we have a 2 in 3 chance of getting a lethal intermission elemental combo and wiping.

With all of that said, the fight will follow this order:

1. **Phase 1** — Fire altar, dip into storm altar for the last tick.
2. **Intermission** — Fire and lightning elemental intermission. We leave Kurog in the middle of the room for 2-3 seconds to desync the future elementals to make earth and frost dodging mechanics easier.
3. **Phase 1** — Earth altar until intermission. We don't need to touch frost as we've already killed the other two elementals.
4. **Intermission** — Earth and frost elemental intermission.
5. **Phase 1** — Frost altar until enrage.

### Phase 1 — Altar of Flame

    The <Marker type="star" /> marker is the stack point for [Searing
    Carnage](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374022) dancing, and the other markers are ranged bait
    points for [Magma Burst](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=382563) pools.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Ranged will bait on the perimeter markers for [Magma Burst](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=382563) pools and stack with melee on <Marker type="star" /> for the [Searing
Carnage](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374022) dance. The fight is scripted so there is a dance after every 2 pool baits, with the sequence labeled in the picture.

1. <Marker type="square" /> — Ranged baiting pools
2. <Marker type="triangle" /> — Ranged baiting pools
3. <Marker type="star" /> — Everyone stacking for dance

   Everyone moves according to their dance WeakAura, left if you don't have the debuff and right if you do. Players moving with the debuff will need to stutter-step to avoid running out of room.

4. <Marker type="moon" /> — Ranged baiting pools
5. <Marker type="diamond" /> — Ranged baiting pools
6. <Marker type="star" /> — Everyone stacking for dance. The add needs to be dead by now `~1:30`.
7. <Marker type="moon" /> — Ranged baiting pools.

   The elemental should be dead by now, so the pools aren't converted into the soaking mechanic.

Soaking is assigned by immunities or tankier specializations, e.g.

```
{square} Rogue
{triangle} Mage
{moon} Monk
{diamond} Hunter
```

### Intermission 1

<ProseImage
  src="/images/strategies/vault/raidplans/kurog-rp-2.jpg"
  height="784"
  width="1394"
  alt=""
  quality="90"

This intermission will feature fire and lightning elementals with the lightning elemental being kill priority. The raid will stack on <Marker type="skull" />, or wherever the adds converge, to bait the [Searing
Carnage](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374022) dance. When the dance starts everyone ignores their WeakAura and moves as a group into the middle of the room. The only lightning soaks immediately follow this first dance. The rest of the intermission is a general priority:

- Stay grouped in melee and follow others during the dance, healers are _required_ to stay in melee as the lightning elemental lusts for healers.
- If you're not grouped when the dance starts, do not cut off the main group with your flames.
- Don't enter the earth quadrant, as the flame elemental spawns fire puddles near players and that's where we're going next.
- If the lightning elemental fixates you with [Lethal Current](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391696/lethal-current) move out of the group, and try not to be inside the lightning elemental's hitbox in the future.

We are not in a rush to kill the flame elemental as we can wait a minor amount of time to recharge our cooldowns; Thaerhum may call a DPS stop depending on the timing. Once the intermission ends, however, we will try to leave Kurog in the center of the room for 2-3 seconds to desync his altar mechanic timings from the elemental timings, otherwise, we have to dodge 2 earth ripple mechanics simultaneously.

### Phase 1 — Altar of earth

<figure>
  <ProseImage

    height="784"
    width="1394"

  />
  <figcaption>
    The add will be stacked with the group except for the 2nd [Erupting
    Bedrock](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=395893/erupting-bedrock).
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The second and most dangerous altar of the fight is earth. The earth altar itself presents fewer mechanics, but the ticking damage is increased as a consequence which will test the healers, tanks, and everyone's ability to use personals. Everyone will remain stacked on the boss, only moving to dodge [Erupting
Bedrock](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=395893/erupting-bedrock) ripples.

- [Enveloping Earth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=391055/enveloping-earth) is the most lethal mechanic to individual players as a `432,678` healing absorb shield. The elemental's tank frontal applies the same healing absorb to the tank. A WeakAura linked below will tell players when to use health pots/stones when they have the shield during the later parts of the phase. Some classes are likely to simply die if they get this shield multiple times in a row.
- [Seismic Rupture](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374705/seismic-rupture) spawns earthen swirlies that summon the Earth Breaker addlets. A quick stun when they spawn is helpful so tanks have some time to get aggro, and then nuked down so they don't kill the tanks.
- [Erupting Bedrock](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=395893/erupting-bedrock) are the concentric miasma rings on the ground that erupt around the boss, and on mythic the elemental as well. If we're successful with keeping Kurog in the middle of the room to desync him the 3 instances of this ability will look like this:

  1. Kurog will cast it first, the mechanic finishes, then the elemental casts it.
  2. Kurog starts his, then the elemental starts. This overlap is dangerous, so a tank will preemptively move the elemental out of the group to make it easier to dodge.
  3. The elemental should be dead by this point, however, the raid will be taking incredible damage from the earth altar stacks and healers will be impaired by the movement here.

## Weakauras

- [Searing Carnage Direction Arrow (grimtotem)](https://wago.io/SxHOCR1WK) provides directional arrows for the fire dance. Players without the debuff get a red arrow that has them go left, and players with the debuff get a green arrow that has them go right.
- [Kurog Grimtotem - Dance](https://wago.io/4saOA8G4D) is a countdown bar for the phase 1 fire dance. It has ticks on the bar to indicate when the fire lands, allowing stutter-stepping.
- [Kurog_M_HealAbsorb_Personal](https://wago.io/BG6o0SO_B) warns you to use a personal if you have the healing absorb above 19 earth stacks and you're low.
- (**Healers**) [Vault of the Incarnates - Glows](https://wago.io/8Pm7cbqJi) glows someone's raid frame with a noteworthy ability, which in this fight is the healing absorbs.
- (**Tanks**) [NGAndersson - Kurog Phase Timing](https://wago.io/SxHOCR1WK) provides a visual for the tanks to know when to move the boss to the lightning altar just before the intermission.
