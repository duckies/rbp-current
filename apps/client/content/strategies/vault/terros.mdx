## Mechanics

Notably, Terros

<Mechanic id={380487} name="Rock Blast" caption="Split-meteor mechanic">

A random player is targeted with a swirling vortex meteor mechanic. It deals 961k nature damage
split evenly among players within 12 yards and leaves an [Aftershock](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=386400) which erupts at the impact location a few seconds later.

<Alert type="warning">
  This goes out at the same time as [Awakened Earth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381486).

<Alert>This mechanic can be solo'd with immunities. üê¢</Alert>

<Mechanic id={381486} name="Awakened Earth" caption="Pillars">
  Several players are debuffed with [Awakened Earth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381486), marking them with a yellow arrow and surrounding them with a small circle. Upon expiration these spawn pillars of the same name that pulsate raid damage until destroyed. These should be placed in a line, or very close together but not stacked (splashing your debuff-mates), and *not in melee*.

  <Alert type="warning">
  This goes out at the same time as [Rock Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=380487). These players should focus on placing their pillar in the correct spot and not soaking.

<Mechanic id={381576} name="Seismic Assault" caption="Pillar-dying DoT">
  Killing a pillar causes [Seismic Assault](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381576), dealing 24k
  damage to the entire raid and applying a DoT for 12 seconds, stacking.

<Mechanic id={377166} name="Resonating Annihilation" caption="Pizza-slice Frontal">
  When Terros reaches 100 energy he will pizza-slice frontal the platform. It deals lethal (478k
  nature) damage to those caught in it, destroying [Awakened
  Earth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381486) pillars in the process, and causes [Fractured
  Rubble](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=378861) to fall from the ceiling which deals impact damage
  and leaving behind miasma.
</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id={383073} name="Shattering Impact" caption="Swirly on Largest Player Clump">
  Terros periodically casts [Shattering Impact](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383073) as a large yellow circle which, if caught within, deals 252k nature damage and knocks players into the air. This mechanic also triggers [Fractured Rubble](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=378861) to fall from the ceiling.

Testing suggests the mechanic targets the largest clump of players, which is typically melee due to the ranged players dealing with pillar mechanics.

<Mechanic id={376279} name="Concussive Slam" caption="Tank Laser Beam">
  Terros will emit a line of energy at the active tank that deals 242k physical damage and increases damage taken by 30% for 45 seconds, stacking. [Concussive Slam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=376279) will destroy any [Awakened Earth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=381486) pillars in the path of the beam.

In the same spirit of Halondrus, the beam is used to break pillars.

<Mechanic id={377505} name="Frenzied Devastation" caption="Soft Enrage">
  If the entire platform is filled with [Resonant Aftermath](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=382458)
  puddles then Terros enrages, casting [Frenzied Devastation](https://www.wowhad.com/spell=377505)
  repeatedly until our faces are melted off.
</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id={388393} name="Tectonic Barrage" caption="Lonely Boss Screeching">
  If no player is within the bosses range he will cast [Tectonic
  Barrage](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=388393) repeatedly.
